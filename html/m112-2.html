      <p>must in order to sit and stand there, while the sun beats</p>
      
      <p>or the rain pours have some strong inducement; something</p>
      
      <p>that puzzles; and then concludes. They must have love;</p>
      
      <p>murder; adultery. And this 
         <span data-title="contrbution"><span class="corr">contribution</span></span> of the audience</p>
      
      <p>was more unfortunate to the dramatist 
         <span data-title="tahn"><span class="corr">than</span></span> to the lyric</p>
      
      <p>singer. Often the actions is too violent for the words.</p>
      
      <p>There is a dislocation between the thought and the action.</p>
      
      <p>No one feels what is said. The emotion is often</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="las ered"><span class="corr">plastered</span></span> on to a dumb figure. But if violence rapidity</p>
      
      <p>movement are dictated by the audience an inevitable 
         <span data-title="confusin"><span class="corr">confusion</span></span></p>
      
      <p>follows. On the other hand the playwright</p>
      
      <p>like the singer has an anomymous vitality,</p>
      
      <p>drawn 
         <span data-title="fro"><span class="corr">from</span></span> other bodies, a 
         <span data-title="pe renniel"><span class="corr">perennial</span></span> common vigour.</p>
      
      <p>Nor is <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-anon">anon</a> 
         <span data-title="dad"><span class="corr">dead</span></span> in ourselves. The crude early 
         <span data-title="ddrams"><span class="corr">dramas</span></span></p>
      
      <p>have still the power to make us ask--as the audience asked--</p>
      
      <p>the childs 
         <span data-title="questin"><span class="corr">question</span></span>: what comes next? <span class="add-inline">a power denied to [illeg.]</span></p>
      
      <p>So we become 
         <span data-title="ourelves"><span class="corr">ourselves</span></span> anonymous in the early plays.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>It is only later when the pressure of silent 
         <span data-title="horaded"><span class="corr">hoarded</span></span></p>
      
      <p>emotion had thrown up words, as the 
         <span data-title="fi gers"><span class="corr">fingers</span></span> of the man at the</p>
      
      <p><a href="../resources/annotations.xml#obj-mono">monotype machine</a> casts letters from the bubbling lead,</p>
      
      <p>that we lose this general quality to gain---</p>
      
      <p>everything it seems. For the 
         <span data-title="curatin"><span class="corr">curtain</span></span> goes on rising</p>
      
      <p>incessantly for fifty years. Now it rises on <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#lit-hen5">Henry the Fifth</a>;</p>
      
      <p>then on <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#lit-mids">Midsummer Nights Dream</a>; on <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#lit-rome">Romeo and Juliet</a>;</p>
      
      <p>on <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#lit-haml">Hamlet</a>; finally on <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#lit-temp">the Tempest</a>. 
         <span data-title="Byt"><span class="corr">By</span></span> that time the sxxgxx</p>
      
      <p>play has outgrown the stage. The stage has become too small</p>
      
      <p>to act this drama. Perhaps after 
         <span data-title="cnuries"><span class="corr">centuries</span></span>, the play will</p>
      
      <p>come to birth again, differently, in <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#lit-magi">the Magic Flute</a>,</p>
      
      <p>in <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#lit-fide">Fidelio</a>. But the play never again fitted the stage</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>33</p>
      
      <p>completely in England. The book after 
         <span data-title="Shakespere"><span class="corr">Shakespeare</span></span> takes the</p>
      
      <p>place of the play. And Anon is dead for ever.</p>
