      <p>Anonymity was a great possession. It gave the early</p>

      <p>become too small for the play. It has outgrown the uncovered</p>

         <span data-title="eh"><i class="corr">the</i></span> sun beats and the rain pours. And the</p>

      <p>There is no sequence. It does not connect; axxxx the</p>
      
      <p>rxmxmxmxmxf the parts are u 
         <span data-title="sevred"><i class="corr">severed</i></span>, and  something runs to</p>
      
      <p>waste. For the anonuymous playwright is

      <p>He flouts

         <span data-title="ony"><i class="corr">only</i></span></p>
      
      <p>for the plot. We are left in the end without an end. The</p>
      
      <p>emotion is wasted.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>But gradually the audience is mastered by the 
         <span data-title="playwrgiht"><i class="corr">playwright</i></span>.</p>
      
      <p>The mist withdraws. So many 
         <span data-title="darmatists"><i class="corr">dramatists</i></span> are 
         <span data-title="explroing"><i class="corr">exploring</i></span></p>

         <span data-title="disocvery"><i class="corr">discovery</i></span>.</p>
      
      <p>So many private people are pressing their weight of</p>

      <p>quiting Spenser. The curtain rises on play 
         <span data-title="afte"><i class="corr">after</i></span> play.</p>
      
      <p>Each time it rises upon a more detached, a more matured</p>
      
      <p>drama. The 
         <span data-title="indivisual"><i class="corr">individual</i></span> on the stage becomes more and more</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="diife entiated"><i class="corr">differentiated</i></span>; and the whole group is more closely</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="rleated"><i class="corr">related</i></span> and less at the mercy of the lp plot. The curtain</p>
      
      <p>rises upon Hxmxmmxmx <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#lit-hen6">Henry the 
            <span data-title="Si th"><i class="corr">Sixth</i></span></a>; and <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#lit-john">King John</a>;</p>

      <p>Finally it rises upon the Tempest. But the play has outgrown</p>
      
      <p>the uncovered theatre where the 
         <span data-title="s n"><i class="corr">sun</i></span> beats and the rain</p>
      
      <p>pours. That 
         <span data-title="thetare"><i class="corr">theatre</i></span> must be replaced by the</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="thestre"><i class="corr">theatre</i></span> of the brain. The playwright is replaced by the man</p>
      
      <p>who writes a book. The audience is replaced by the reader.</p>
      
      <p>Anon is dead.</p>

      <br>
      
      <p>The audience at the 
         <span data-title="Elizabetahn"><i class="corr">Elizabethan</i></span> play was not an 
         <span data-title="audiejce"><i class="corr"></i></span></p>
      
      <p>of readers. They had to draw 
         <span data-title="int"><i class="corr">in</i></span> the play through their ears, through their eyes</p>
      
      <p>They could not deepen the impression and renew</p>
      
      <p>it at a table in a private room. This perhaps explains</p>
      
      <p>the scarcity of Elizabethan criticism; and the general nature</p>
      
      <p>of what criticism there is. Both <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-psid">Sidney</a> and <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-bjon">Jonson</a></p>
      
      <p>deal with the general rules of poetry; not with the 
         <span data-title="particuar"><i class="corr">particular</i></span></p>
      
      <p>play or poem. The lack of a book of the words accounts too</p>
      
      <p>for the long pause, between <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-wsha">Sahkepares</a> death</p>
      
      <p>and the eighteenth century, 
         <span data-title="whe"><i class="corr">when</i></span> the plays of

      <p>even hang suspended, 
         <span data-title="unrea ised"><i class="corr">unrealised</i></span>. They had to wait until the</p>
      
      <p>printed book was in many hands before they received</p>
      
      <p>the life that the reader 
         <span data-title="co fers"><i class="corr">confers</i></span> Much that was lost</p>
      
      <p>in the playhouse was 
         <span data-title="disocvered"><i class="corr">discovered</i></span> in the private room.</p>
      
      <p>But 
         <span data-title="mu h"><i class="corr">much</i></span> was lost for ever when the playhouse shut.</p>
      
      <p>Txmxmmxmxmxmxmmxmxmxmmxmxmxmxmxm We have lost the sound of the</p>
      
      <p>spoken word; all that the sight of the actors bodies</p>
      
      <p>suggests to the mind through the eye. We have lost the</p>
      
      <p>sense of being part of the audience. We miss a 
         <span data-title="th usnd"><i class="corr">thousand</i></span></p>
      
      <p>suggestions that the dramatist conveyed by the inflection</p>
      
      <p>of voice, by gesture, by the placing of the actors bodies.</p>
      
      <p>This can still be proved by comparing our impression</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="aft"><i class="corr">after</i></span> seeing the play acted with our impression after reading</p>
      
      <p>the play alone. But as the actor 
         <span data-title="ipmports"><i class="corr">imports</i></span> much that is of</p>
      
      <p>his own day, and 
         <span data-title="foreing"><i class="corr">[foreign?]</i></span> to the past, so that there is t</p>

      <p>Presumably the earlier plays, in which the playwright</p>
      
      <p>and the audience were mxxxx in closer cooperation, are the</p>
      
      <p>more damaged by reading them. The reader 
         <span data-title="instinctivly"><i class="corr">instinctively</i></span> tries</p>
      
      <p>to be there in person. He tries to supply the trumpets</p>
      
      <p>and the flags; the citizens and the apprentices. He</p>
      
      <p>nourishes the 
         <span data-title="inadeuate"><i class="corr">inadequate</i></span> emotion with a dip into <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-phen">
            <span data-title="Hensloew"><i class="corr">Henslowe</i></span></a>,</p>
      
      <p>with a dip into <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-rhol">
            <span data-title="Holigshed"><i class="corr">Holinshed</i></span></a>. He labours to supply the sunk</p>
      
      <p>part of the play. He is 
         <span data-title="perpetaully"><i class="corr">perpetually</i></span> rebuffexd. He is apt</p>
      
      <p>to become not a reader but a student; a 
         <span data-title="crafeul"><i class="corr">careful</i></span> collector of</p>
      
      <p>old scattered bones. At some point however in Elizabethan</p>
      
      <p>drama the readerr is born. When the dramatist 
         <span data-title="beceomes"><i class="corr">becomes</i></span> consi</p>
      
      <p>of the play as a work of art; when he is able to unite the</p>
      
      <p>play by something in himself--his personality, his</p>
      
      <p>conception-- it is then that, he brings the reader into 
         <span data-title="beig"><i class="corr">being</i></span></p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>We can be sure then that the reader has been</p>
      
      <p>in existence for round about four hundred years. But his</p>
      
      <p>life history is an obscure one. At some point his ear must</p>
      
      <p>have lost 
         <span data-title="i s"><i class="corr">its</i></span> 
         <span data-title="acutness"><i class="corr">acuteness</i></span>; then his 
         <span data-title="eyees"><i class="corr">eyes</i></span> became dulled.</p>
      
      <p>Later he became more conscious of the suggestions and echoes</p>
      
      <p>in words. He imported much into the 
         <span data-title="w itten"><i class="corr">written</i></span> word that was</p>
      
      <p>unintended xxxxxxx by the writer. A word given in its</p>
      
      <p>Elizabethan spelling brings in suggestions that give it</p>
      
      <p>almost another meaning. The words suggest other manners,</p>
      
      <p>other clothes. They accent the contrast between one society</p>
      
      <p>and another. And as the habit of reading becomes universal,</p>
      
      <p>many 
         <span data-title="varities"><i class="corr">varieties</i></span> of reader are created. There are the</p>
