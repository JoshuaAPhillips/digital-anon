      <p>so long as the play was dominant. The audience at the play</p>
      
      <p>house had to draw in txxxx the play with their eyes and</p>
      
      <p>ears. Without a book of the words they could not deepen and</p>
      
      <p>revise the impression left by the play, or ask those</p>
      
      <p>questions that are debated now in every newspaper. The lack</p>
      
      <p>of general reading accounts for the long pause between</p>
      
      <p><a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-wsha">Shakespeares</a> death and the 
         <span data-title="k8th"><i class="corr">18th</i></span> century when the plays of</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="Shakespere"><i class="corr">Shakespeare</i></span> hung suspended, unrealised-- even in 17</p>
      
      <p><a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-mmor">Morgann</a> could say that 
         <span data-title="Shakespera"><i class="corr">Shakespeare</i></span> still lacked</p>
      
      <p>half his 
         <span data-title="proer"><i class="corr">proper</i></span> fame. The lack of a reading public</p>
      
      <p>accounts too for the scarcity of criticism and for the</p>
      
      <p>general nature of what criticism there is. Both <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-psid">Sidney</a> and</p>
      
      <p><a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-bjon">Jonson</a> are writing for the small critical public, and thus</p>
      
      <p>deal with 
         <span data-title="ggneral"><i class="corr">general</i></span> questions, and not with 
         <span data-title="partciualr"><i class="corr">particular</i></span> books</p>
      
      <p>and

      <p>As the habit of reading becomes universal, readers split off</p>
      
      <p>into different classes. There is the 
         <span data-title="specilaised"><i class="corr">specialised</i></span> reader, who</p>
      
      <p>attaches himself to certain aspects of the

      <p>Again there is the very large class of perfectly literate</p>
      
      <p>people who strip many miles of print yearly from paper</p>
      
      <p>yet never read a word. Finally

      <p>that when his attention is distracted, in times of public</p>
      
      <p>crisis, the writer exclaims: I can write no more.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>But the presence of the reader was felt even</p>
      
      <p>while the play was still on 
         <span data-title="th"><i class="corr">the</i></span> stage. It was for him that</p>
