      <p><span class="del">Anon died round 18787. It was the printed book</span></p>

      <p>The heart of this vast
         <span data-title="prolieferation"><span class="corr">proliferation</span></span> of printed pages</p>
      
      <p>remains the song. The song has the same power over the reader</p>
      
      <p>in the 20th 
         <span data-title="cen ury"><span class="corr">century</span></span> as over the hearer in the 11th. To enjoy</p>
      
      <p>singing, to enjoy hearing the sing, must be the most</p>
      
      <p>deep rooted, the toughest of human instincts comparable</p>
      
      <p>for persistency with the instinct of self preservation</p>
      foreign to the bodies instinct
      
      <p>It is indeed the instinct of self preservation.</p>
      
      <p>Only  when we put two and two together--two pencil strokes,</p>
      
      <p>two written words, two bricks do we overcome
         <span data-title="doissolution"><span class="corr">dissolution</span></span></p>
      
      <p>and set up some stake against oblivion. The passion with</p>
      
      <p>which we seek out these
         <span data-title="creation"><span class="corr">creations</span></span> and attempt endlessly,</p>
      
      <p>perpetually, to make them is of a piece with the instinct</p>
      
      <p>that sets us preserving
         <span data-title="out"><span class="corr">our</span></span> bodies, with clothes, food,</p>
      
      <p>roofs, from destruction.</p>

      <p>forces that cover over the original song--books themselves,</p>
      
      <p>and the readers of books. If science were so advanced that</p>
      
      <p>we could at this moment X ray the singers mind<span class="add-above">as she moved</span> we should</p>
      
      <p>find a nimbus surrounding the song; a 
         <span data-title="steeam"><span class="corr">stream steam</span></span> of</p>
      
      <p>influences. Some we can name--education; class;</p>
      
      <p>the pressure of society. But they are so many, and so</p>

      <p>interwoven and so obscure that it is simpler to invent</p>
      
      <p>for them nonsense names--- say <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-nin">Nin</a> <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-crot">Crot</a> and <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-pull">Pully</a>. Nin</p>
      
      <p>Crot and Pully are always at their work, tugging, obscuring,</p>
      
      <p>distorting. Some are visible only to the writer. Others</p>
      
      <p>only to the reader. More and more 
         <span data-title=" omplex"><span class="corr">complex</span></span> do they become as</p>
      
      <p>time passes. The song beneath is only to be
         <span data-title="disocovered"><span class="corr">discovered</span></span></p>
      
      <p>in a flash of recognition; Some say they feel it when their</p>
      
      <p>beards bristle; others that a thrill runs down the nerves</p>
      
      <p>of the thigh. But the song is there still. For example:</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>....3....</p>
      
      <p>That babbling, child like, story telling singer, that</p>
      
      <p>gossip at the farm yard door, that
         <span data-title="inno ent"><span class="corr">innocent</span></span> eyed, naked,</p>
      
      <p>lustful, <span class="del">now</span><span class="add-above">alternately</span> obscene

      <p>a great artist died in 147<span class="del">8</span>, And with him died</p>
      
      <p>the part of his song that the audience sang--the voice that</p>
      
      <p>filled in pauses, and added sometimes a 
         <span data-title="nonsenical"><span class="corr">nonsensical</span></span> chorus</p>
      
      <p>To follow his fortunes further we must turn to one of those</p>
      
      <p>commentators who tell us us so much about the invisible</p>
      
      <p>influences. about <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-nin">Nin</a> <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-crot">Crot</a> and <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-pull">Pulley</a>.</p>
