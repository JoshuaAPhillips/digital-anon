      Apparent errors have been explicitly corrected in sic / corr tags, wrapped in a choice
      element.
      
      
      Names and references to places and literary works have been wrapped in rs tags which

      Text encoded as part of 'The Digital "Anon": A Digital Genetic Edition of Virginia
      Woolf's Final Essays'. This project, funded by Leverhulme Grant ECF-2022-602, seeks
      to construct a TEI-XML based digital edition of the drafts of 'Anon' and 'The Reader',
      among the final documents Woolf wrote before her death.
