      <p>boughs innumerable birds sang; but their song was only heard</p>
      
      <p>by a few skin clad hunters in the <span data-title="lcearings"><i class="corr">clearings</i></span>. Did the desire</p>
      
      <p>to sing come to one of those huntsmen because he heard the</p>
      
      <p>birds sing, and so rested his axe against the tree for a</p>
      
      <p>moment? But the tree had to be felled; and a hut made</p>
      
      <p>from its branches before the human voice sang too.</p>

         <p>A birdes voice</p>

      <p>The voice that broke the <span data-title="sielnce"><i class="corr">silence</i></span> of the forests was</p>

      <p>But there was also the the other less visible connection</p>
      
      <p>--the common belief. That track between the houses in the</p>

      <p>to the well. In spring it led to the Maypole, where they</p>
      
      <p>danced and sung Anons song. At Midsummer they lit the bon</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="fir"><i class="corr">fire</i></span> on the hill. At Christmas the mummers acted the old</p>
      
      <p>Anons old play; and the boys came singing his wassailing</p>  
      
      <p>song. The road led to the old graves, to the stones where</p>
      
      <p>in time past the English had done sacrifice. The <span data-title="peasnts"><i class="corr">peasants</i></span>,</p>

      <p>and summer and winter. The old Gods lay hidden beneath the</p>
      
      <p>new. It was to them led by Anon that they did worship,</p>
      
      <p>in their coats of green leaves, bearing swords in their hands</p>
      
      <p>dancing through the houses, enacting their ancient parts.</p>
