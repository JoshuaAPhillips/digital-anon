      <p>ANON.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>"For many centuries 
         afte
         after Britain became an island" the</p>
      
      <p><a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-whar">historian</a> says ""the untamed forest was king. Its moist</p>
      
      <p>and mossy floor was hidden from Heavens eye by a close drawn</p>
      
      <p>curtain woven of innumerable tree tops." On those matted</p>
      
      <p>boughs innumerable birds sang; but their song was only heard</p>
      
      <p>by a few skin clad hunters in the <span data-title="lcearings"><span class="corr">clearings</span></span>. Did the desire</p>
      
      <p>to sing come to one of those huntsmen because he heard the</p>
      
      <p>birds sing, and so rested his axe against the tree for a</p>
      
      <p>moment? But the tree had to be felled; and a hut made</p>
      
      <p>from its branches before the human voice sang too.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>By a bank as I lay</p>
      
      <p>Musing myself alone, hey ho!</p>
      
      <p>A birdes voice</p>
      
      <p>Did me rejoice,</p>
      
      <p>Singing before the day</p>
      
      <p>And me thought in her lay</p>
      
      <p>She said, winter was past, hey ho!</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>The voice that broke the <span data-title="sielnce"><span class="corr">silence</span></span> of the forests was</p>
      
      <p>the voice of <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-anon">Anon</a>. Some one heard the song and <span data-title="re embered"><span class="corr">remembered</span></span> it</p>
      
      <p>for it was later <span data-title="wrteen  "><span class="corr">written</span></span> down, beautifully on parchment.</p>
      
      <p>Thus the singer had his audience, but the audience was so</p>
      
      <p>little interested in his name that he never thought to give</p>
      
      <p>it. For the audience was itself the singer;   Terly terlow"</p>
      
      <p>they sand; and "By, by lullay" filling in the pauses,</p>
      
      <p>helping <span class="add-above">out</span> with a chorus. Every body shared in the emotion</p>
      
      <p>of Anons song, and supplied the story. Anon sang because</p>
      
      <p>spring has come; or winter is gone; because he loves; because</p>
      
      <p>he is hungry, or lustful; or merry. or because he adores</p>
      
      <p>some God. Anon is sometimes man; sometimes woman. He is the</p>

      <p>By shutting out a chimney or a factory we can still</p>
      
      <p>see what Anon saw-- the bird haunted reed whispering fen,</p>
      
      <p>the down and the green scar never quite <span class="add-above">not yet</span> healed along which</p>
      
      <p>he came when he made his journeys. He was a simple singer,</p>

      <p>the audience join in the chorus. <span data-title="Somemimes"><span class="corr">Sometimes</span></span> he made a few lines</p>

      <p>the service of the church. He was to be found acting the</p>

      <p>churchyard, or later was given a pitch for his drama in the</p>

      <p>recorded in old letter books and ledgers. It makes the</p>

      <p>But there was also the the other less visible connection</p>
      
      <p>--the common belief. That track between the houses in the</p>

      <p>But before Chaucers time thxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
      
      <p>it was trod daily.   It led <span class="del">the peasants</span> to the tree</p>
      
      <p>to the well. In spring it led to the Maypole, where they</p>
      
      <p>danced and sung Anons song. At Midsummer they lit the bon</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="fir"><span class="corr">fire</span></span> on the hill. At Chrismas the mummers acted the old</p>
      
      <p>Anons old play; and the boys came singing his wassailing</p>  
      
      <p>song. The road led to the old graves, to the stones where</p>
      
      <p>in time past the English had done sacrifice. The <span data-title="peasnts"><span class="corr">peasants</span></span>,</p>
      
      <p>led by anon, still went that way by instinct, in spring</p>
      
      <p>and summer and winter. The old Gods lay hidden beneath the</p>
      
      <p>new. It was to them led by Anon that they did worship,</p>
      
      <p>in their coats of green leaves, bearing swords in their hands</p>
      
      <p>dancing through the houses, enacting their ancient parts.</p>
