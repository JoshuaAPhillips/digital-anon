      <p>but they nxmxmxx sit there silent. They neither

      <p>spoken for them in poetry. And there was <span class="del">always</span> something</p>
      
      <p>illicit in their pleasure. The preacher and the magistrate</p>

      <p>The play then owes its <span class="add-above">heightened</span> intensity to the audience in the</p>

      <p>Bacons contempt was for hyperbole; not for the art of</p>
      
      <p>speech. He was teaching the ranting players to speak</p>
      
      <p>slowly, closely, subtly. He was proving that there is 
         <span data-title="anothe"><span class="corr">another</span></span></p>
      
      <p>kind of poetry, the poetry of prose. He was bringing the</p>
      
      <p>prose of the mind into being. And thus by increasing the</p>
      
      <p>range of the poet, bu making it possible for him to express</p>
      
      <p>more, he was making an end of anonymity.</p>
