      <p>The lack of <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-cmar">Marlowes</a> name, or <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-tkyd">Kyds</a>, shows how largely</p>

      <p>moulded in transition that the author had no

      <p>And the audience was a large one. Fifteen hundred</p>

      <p>It was they who made the playwright capable of his great</p>
      
      <p>strides, of vast audacities beyond the reach of the solitary</p>

      <p>solitary writer with his mind fixed upon the reader in the</p>
      
      <p>great room. If we could measure the 
         <span data-title="e ec"><i class="corr">effect</i></span> of the audience</p>
      
      <p>upon the play we should have a hold which is denied us</p>
      
      <p>upon the play itself. But the audience, drawn though it is</p>
      
      <p>by an

      <p>and the play. They come 
         <span data-title="crodwing"><i class="corr">crowding</i></span> across the river daily;</p>
      
      <p>but they nxmxmxx sit there silent. They neither

      <p>out loud what they had never said yet. They heard their</p>
      
      <p>aspirations, their profanities, their ribaldries</p>
      
      <p>spoken for them in poetry. And there was <span class="del">always</span> something</p>
      
      <p>illicit in their pleasure. The preacher and the magistrate</p>
      
      <p>were always denouncing their emotion. That too must</p>
      
      <p>have given it intensity.</p>

      <p>The play then owes its <span class="add-above">heightened</span> intensity to the audience in the</p>
      
      <p>penny seats. At their

      <p>it is, like our own detective stories and best sellers</p>
