      <p>It was the printed book with the authors name attached that</p>
      
      <p>was the death of Anon. <span class="add-above">After that</span>The audience was separated from</p>
      
      <p>the singer. After that (1478) the sing was attached to</p>

      <p>The heart of this vast proliferation of printed</p>
      
      <p>pages is the song. The song has the same power over the</p>
      
      <p>reader in the 20th century as over the hearer in the</p>
      
      <p>11th. To enjoy singing, to enjoy 
         <span data-title="h aring"><i class="corr">hearing</i></span> the song,</p>
      
      <p>must be the deepest rooted and tough of human instincts.</p>
      
      <p>It is an instinct of self-preservation, for only when we</p>
      
      <p>put two and two together to we overcome dissolution. Two</p>
      
      <p>lines, two words, two 
         <span data-title="bri cks"><i class="corr">bricks</i></span> make way against oblivion.</p>
      
      <p><span class="del">Making whatever it is gives us life;</span> and the passion</p>
      
      <p>with which we seek for these creations, and attempt to</p>
      
      <p>make them, is of a piece with the instinct that</p>
      
      <p>sets us preserving our bodies from wet, or cold.</p>
      
      <p>But with the printing press came into existence</p>
      
      <p>forces that cover over the original song--books</p>
      
      <p>themselves and the readers of books. Could we at this</p>
