      <p>curtain of innumerable treetops. " On the matted bough</p>
      
      <p>innumerable birds 
         <span data-title="snag"><span class="corr">sang</span></span>; but their song was only heard by a</p>
      
      <p>few skin clad hunters in the 
         <span data-title="claetings"><span class="corr">clearings</span></span>. Did the desire</p>
      
      <p>to sing come to one of those <span class="add-above">barbarians</span> savages because he 
         <span data-title="geard"><span class="corr">heard</span></span> the</p>
      
      <p>birds sing, and so rested his axe against the tree for a</p>
      
      <p>moment? Anyhow, the tree was felled; some sort of hut</p>
      
      <p>was made from its branches; and the clearing became larger;</p>
      
      <p>the birds 
         <span data-title="f   er"><span class="corr">fewer</span></span>; and the human voice sang instead. The first</p>
      
      <p>songs are out of door songs; spring songs; summer songs;</p>
      
      <p>winter songs.</p>

      <p>By a bank as I lay</p>
      
      <p>Musing myself alone, hey ho!</p>
      
      <p>A birdes voice</p>
      
      <p>Did me rejoice,</p>
      
      <p>Singing before the day;</p>

      <p>They were out of door songs, because there was no</p>
      
      <p>comfort indoors, little light, and no books. The eye</p>
      
      <p>therefore was more active in in ourselves. The eye is the</p>
      
      <p>young sense; the sense that is attached to the body.</p>

      <p>logged; or a down still covered with turf only.</p>
      
      <p>On the down is the green scar still, to mark the</p>
      
      <p>road along which the travellers came, past the circle where</p>
      
      <p>they were buried; past the stone that marks the meeting place</p>

      <p>heard that particular song, or it would not have been written</p>
      
      <p>down. The singer then had his 
         <span data-title="audeince"><span class="corr">audience</span></span>; but the audience was</p>
      
      <p>so little interested in his name that he never thought to</p>

      <p>It was the printed book with the authors name attached that</p>
      
      <p>was the death of Anon. <span class="add-above">after that</span>The audience was separated from</p>
      
      <p>the singer. After that (1478) the sing was attached to</p>
      
      <p>the singer. Anon gives place to James or Thomas; he lives in </p>
      
      <p>in a house; and he has books.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>....2....</p>
      
      <p>The heart of this vast proliferation of printed</p>
      
      <p>pages is the song. The song has the same power over the</p>
      
      <p>reader in the 20th century as over the hearer in the</p>
      
      <p>11th. To enjoy singing, to enjoy 
         <span data-title="h aring"><span class="corr">hearing</span></span> the song,</p>
      
      <p>must be the deepest rooted and tough of human instincts.</p>
      
      <p>It is an instinct of self-preservation, for only when we</p>
      
      <p>put two and two together to we overcome dissolution. Two</p>
      
      <p>lines, two words, two 
         <span data-title="bri cks"><span class="corr">bricks</span></span> make way against oblivion.</p>
      
      <p><span class="del">Making whatever it is gives us life;</span> and the passion</p>
      
      <p>with which we seek for these creations, and attempt to</p>
      
      <p>make them, is of a piece with the instinct that</p>
      
      <p>sets us preserving our bodies from wet, or cold.</p>
      
      <p>But with the printing press came into existence</p>
      
      <p>forces that cover over the original song--books</p>
      
      <p>themselves and the readers of books. Could we at this</p>
      
      <p>this moment X ray the singers mind we shound ind</p>
      
      <p>a nimbus surrounding the song; a

      <p>influences <span class="del">to which so many ugly
