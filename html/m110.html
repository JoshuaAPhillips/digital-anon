      <p>Spenser with his eye upon the reader in the great room.</p>
      
      <p>Yet the audience for all its size and compulsion is silent.</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>That is one of the deep gulfs that lies between us</p>
      
      <p>and the play. They crowd there; daily; but they neither</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="priase"><span class="corr">praise</span></span> nor blame. We must compare it with our

         , in their early days.</p>
      
      <p>A new art comes upon us so 
         <span data-title="surpinsgly"><span class="corr">surprisingly</span></span> that we sit</p>
      
      <p>silent , recognising what we cannot measure.</p>
      
      <p>To the Elizabethans the expressive power of words</p>
      
      <p>after their long inadequacy 
         <span data-title="ust"><span class="corr">must</span></span> have been overwhelming.</p>
      
      <p>There at the <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#pla-glob">

      <p>reading had been the Bible or some old 
         <span data-title="chonicle"><span class="corr">chronicle</span></span> came out</p>
      
      <p>into the light of the present moment. They saw themselves</p>
      
      <p>splendidly dressed. They heard 
         <span data-title="themslves"><span class="corr">themselves</span></span> saying out loud</p>
      
      <p>what they had never said yet. They heard their aspirations,</p>

      <br>
      
      <p>The play then owes its hyperbole to the audience in the</p>

         <span data-title="vio;ent"><span class="corr">violent</span></span>; it xmxmxmmxmx</p>
      
      <p>it is coarse; it is poexxx xmxmxmxm a parody, of actual</p>

      <p>scholars. Their 
         <span data-title="silenc"><span class="corr">silence</span></span> is harder to explain. For they were</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="redares"><span class="corr">readers</span></span>; they had the Latins and the Greeks at the back</p>
      
      <p>of their minds. How could it have been that the trained</p>
      
      <p>taste of such 
         <span data-title="speactoars"><span class="corr">spectators</span></span> received the extraordinary</p>

      <p>The soul that walked between delicate groves keeps to a</p>

      <p>Anonymity was a great possession. It gave the early</p>
      
      <p>writing a general nature. It gave us the 
         <span data-title="ballds"><span class="corr">ballads</span></span>; it</p>
      
      <p>gave us the songs. It allowed us to know nothing of the</p>
      
      <p>mans name. <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-anon">Anon</a> had great privileges. He is not</p>
      
      <p>resopnsible. He is not self conscious. He can borrow.</p>

         <span data-title="very"><span class="corr">every</span></span> one feels.</p>
      
      <p>No one asks that he shall stamp his own name on his work.</p>
      
      <p>He keeps at a distance from the present moment.</p>
      
      <p>Anon the lyric poet repeats over and over again</p>
      
      <p>that flowers fade; that death is the 
         <span data-title="ned"><span class="corr">end</span></span>. He is never</p>
      
      <p>tired of celebrating red roses and white breasts.</p>
      
      <p>The anonymous playwright has like the singer this nameless</p>
      
      <p>vitality, 
         <span data-title="somwthing"><span class="corr">something</span></span> drawn from the crowd in the penny</p>

      <br>
      
      <p>But at some point there comes a break when anonymity</p>
      
      <p>withdraws. It comes presumably when the 
         <span data-title="playwrgight"><span class="corr">playwright</span></span> has</p>
      
      <p>
         <span data-title="abosrbed"><span class="corr">absorbed</span></span> the 
         <span data-title="contrbution"><span class="corr">contribution</span></span> of the audience; and returns it</p>

      <p>master of the playwright; yet is not separate from him.</p>
      
      <p>A common life still unites them, but the playwright becomes</p>
      
      <p>increasingly diminant. This separation comes fitfully.</p>

      <p>had stopped.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>The darkness had
