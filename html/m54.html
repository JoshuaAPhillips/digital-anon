      <p>The printing press brought the past into existence.</p>
      
      <p>It brought into existence the man who is conscious of the

      <p>the man who sees his time, zzzzz against a back ground of</p>

      <p>his

      <p>tells us that he has a library; that he owns a mastiff;</p>

      <p>see the house as it was in Spensers time we should see</p>
      
      <p>tracks raying out from the great house across the fields to</p>
      
      <p>the cottage, to the farm, even to the hovel. War connected</p>
      
      <p>them. Armour, if the enemy came was stored in the church.</p>
      
      <p>The young men practised the great English art of</p>

      <p>in the medieval letters. It is 
         <span data-title="th"><span class="corr">the</span></span> staple of the whole</p>
      
      <p>correspondence. But there was also the other less</p>

      <p>the different houses has been grown over, like the</p>
      
      <p>track along which the pilgrims rode to Canterbury. No one</p>

      <p>For the play itself was still anonymous. The lack of Marlowes</p>

         <span data-title="itslef"><span class="corr">itself</span></span> enough to show how largely the play was</p>
      
      <p>a common product, written by one hand, but so moulded</p>
      
      <p>in transition from actor to 
         <span data-title="acotr"><span class="corr">actor</span></span> that the author had no</p>
      
      <p>sense of property in it. It was half the work of the audience.</p>

      <p>one of the deep gulfs that lies between us and the Eliza</p>
      
      <p>bethan play. The audience was a large one. Fifteen</p>

      <p>Their presence, in the penny part of the house, is obvious.</p>
