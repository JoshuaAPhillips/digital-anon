         <span data-title="th"><i class="corr">the</i></span> bungalows, it is because the</p>
      
      <p>connection between it and the village is lost. If we could</p>
      
      <p>see the house as it was in Spensers time we should see</p>
      
      <p>tracks raying out from the great house across the fields to</p>
      
      <p>the cottage, to the farm, even to the hovel. War connected</p>
      
      <p>them. Armour, if the enemy came was stored in the church.</p>
      
      <p>The young men practised the great English art of</p>
      
      <p>the long bow. Also, there was the other fight, the 
         <span data-title="pertual"><i class="corr">perpetual</i></span></p>
      
      <p>fight with nature. They must together plough and sow if the</p>
      
      <p>winter were not to starve them. This connection xxx</p>
      
      <p>between master and man is painfully and minutely recorded</p>
      
      <p>in the medieval letters. It is 
         <span data-title="th"><i class="corr">the</i></span> staple of the whole</p>
      
      <p>correspondence. But there was also the other less</p>
      
      <p>visible connection--the common belief. That bond between</p>
      
      <p>the different houses has been grown over, like the</p>
      
      <p>track along which the pilgrims rode to Canterbury. No one</p>
      
      <p>drives there now. <span class="add-above">[illeg.]</span>. But 
         <span data-title="whe"><i class="corr">when</i></span> Spenser came to Penshurst that</p>
      
      <p>track led from house to house. It led to the village green.</p>
      
      <p>It led to the tree; to the well. In the spring they danced</p>
      
      <p>round the Maypole; at midsummer they lit the bon fire on the</p>
      
      <p>hill; at Christmas the mummers acted their dumb show;</p>
