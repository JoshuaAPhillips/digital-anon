      <p>Anonymity was a great possession. It gave the early writing</p>
      
      <p>an impersonality, a generality. It gave us the 
         <span data-title="ballds"><i class="corr">ballads</i></span>;</p>
      
      <p>it gave us the songs. It allowed us to know 
         <span data-title="notning"><i class="corr">nothing</i></span> of the</p>
      
      <p>writer; and so to concentrate upon his song. <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-anon">Anon</a> had</p>

      <p>conscious. He is not self conscious. He can borrow. He can</p>
      
      <p>repeat. He can say what every one feels. No 
         <span data-title="ne"><i class="corr">one</i></span> tries to</p>
      
      <p>stamp his own name, to

         <span data-title="expereince"><i class="corr">experience</i></span>, in his</p>
      
      <p>work. He keeps at a distance from the present moment.</p>
      
      <p>Anon the lyric poet repeats over and over again</p>
      
      <p>that flowers fade; that death is the 
         <span data-title="ned"><i class="corr">end</i></span>. He is 
         <span data-title="nver"><i class="corr">never</i></span> tired</p>
      
      <p>of celebrating red roses and white breasts. The anonymous</p>
      
      <p>playwright has like the singer this 
         <span data-title="namless"><i class="corr">nameless</i></span> vitality,</p>
      
      <p>something drawn from the crowd in the penny seats and not yet</p>
      
      <p>dead in ourselves. We can still become anonymous and forget</p>
      
      <p>something that we have learnt when we read the plays to which</p>
      
      <p>no one has troubled to set a name.</p>

      <p>But at 
         <span data-title="asome"><i class="corr">some</i></span> point there comes a break when anonymity</p>
      
      <p>withdraws. Does it come when the playwright has absorbed</p>
      
      <p>the 
         <span data-title="contrbution"><i class="corr">contribution</i></span> of the audience; and can return to them</p>

      <p>We can suppose that the reading public was brought into</p>
      
      <p>existence by two causesl when the playhouse was shut down in</p>

      <p>theatre--when, that is, it could only be fully realised</p>

      <p>the reading public must have been<span class="add-above">was</span> a small one <span class="add-inline">,</span> <span class="del">and</span></p>
      
      <p>composed mainly of scholars and aristocrats. The lack of</p>
      
      <p>general common reading is proven by the long pause,</p>
      
      <p>between <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-wsha">
            <span data-title="Sahkespares"><i class="corr">Shakespeare's</i></span></a> death and the eighteenth century,</p>
