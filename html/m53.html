          Britain became an island</p>
      
      <p>the <a href="../resources/annotations.xml#psn-gtre">historian</a> says, the untamed forest was king.</p>
      
      <p>On the matted boughs of that forest innumerable birds sang;</p>
      
      <p>but their song was only heard by a few skin clad hunters</p>
      
      <p>in the clearings. Did the desire to sing come to one</p>
      
      <p>of those savages because he heard the birds sing? <span class="add-above">&amp; did</span><span class="del">Did he</span></p>

         <span data-title="ws"><span class="corr">was</span></span> made from its branches, and</p>
      
      <p>then by degrees, the clearing became larger; the birds</p>
      
      <p>fewer; and the human voice sung instead. <span class="add-inline">&amp;</span> The first songs</p>

      <p>The writer, who is distinct from the minstrel, whose words</p>

      <p>acutely what is before him without <span class="add-above">the</span> shadow ; his ear is</p>
      
      <p>stimulated by the
