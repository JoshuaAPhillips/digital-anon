          <l>there was much to stimulate it. There were the crimsons &amp;</l>

          <l>also <del>highly</del> <add>[in the along?]</add> pricked. Books were read aloud.</l>
          <l>Each word was given the sharpness &amp; substance of the</l>
          <l>speaking voice And <del>then</del> music – the lords &amp;</l>
          <l>ladies sang his words; added to their sharpness &amp;</l>
