          <p>M108 [The Reader]. Typescript fragment, with the author's ms. corrections, unsigned and undated. 7p. Paginated 23-28, with an unpaginated page at end.</p>
          <p>These and successive folders of [The Reader] were contained in two multigrip folders, headed by Virginia Woolf: "Turning the page"; "Transformations" and "Spare sheets of T.P." labels on the spines. They are filed under her Anon, holograph and typescript fragments.</p>
          <p>The fragments grouped in the successive folders under [The reader] may or may not have formed part of Anon. They have been grouped in this fashion based on the evidence of paper and typewriters. The pagination 23-28 is the lowest in the sequence. Internal evidence would indicate that manuscript drafts preceded that of Anon, since Articles, 1938-9 notebook contains a fragment. Some of the versos of this run of material contains fragments of typescripts of Between the Acts and other contemporary works.</p>
