          The word remind us that if the great Elizabethan
          house,  or  looks to us out of proportion,
          xmxmx a derelict among 
            th (the) bungalows, it is because the
          connection between it and the village is lost. If we could
          see the house as it was in  time we should see
          tracks raying out from the great house across the fields to
          the cottage, to the farm, even to the hovel. War connected
          them. Armour, if the enemy came was stored in the church.
          The young men practised the great English art of
          the long bow. Also, there was the other fight, the 
            pertual (perpetual)
          fight with nature. They must together plough and sow if the
          winter were not to starve them. This connection xxx
          between master and man is painfully and minutely recorded
          in the medieval letters. It is 
            th (the) staple of the whole
          correspondence. But there was also the other less
          visible connection--the common belief. That bond between
          the different houses has been grown over, like the
          track along which the  rode to . No one
          drives there now. <sup>[illeg.]</sup>. But 
            whe (when)  came to  that
          track led from house to house. It led to the village green.
          It led to the tree; to the well. In the spring they danced
          round the Maypole; at midsummer they lit the bon fire on the
          hill; at Christmas the mummers acted their dumb show;
          the boys came wassailing xmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxm

          at Harvest time the God was worshipped in the
