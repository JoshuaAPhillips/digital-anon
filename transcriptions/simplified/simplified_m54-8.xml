          The word remind us that if the great Elizabethan<br/>
          house,  or  looks to us out of proportion,<br/>
          xmxmx a derelict among 
            the (th) bungalows, it is because the<br/>
          connection between it and the village is lost. If we could<br/>
          see the house as it was in  time we should see<br/>
          tracks raying out from the great house across the fields to<br/>
          the cottage, to the farm, even to the hovel. War connected<br/>
          them. Armour, if the enemy came was stored in the church.<br/>
          The young men practised the great English art of<br/>
          the long bow. Also, there was the other fight, the 
            perpetual (pertual)<br/>
          fight with nature. They must together plough and sow if the<br/>
          winter were not to starve them. This connection xxx<br/>
          between master and man is painfully and minutely recorded<br/>
          in the medieval letters. It is 
            the (th) staple of the whole<br/>
          correspondence. But there was also the other less<br/>
          visible connection--the common belief. That bond between<br/>
          the different houses has been grown over, like the<br/>
          track along which the  rode to . No one<br/>
          drives there now. <sup>[illeg.]</sup>. But 
            when (whe)  came to  that<br/>
          track led from house to house. It led to the village green.<br/>
          It led to the tree; to the well. In the spring they danced<br/>
          round the Maypole; at midsummer they lit the bon fire on the<br/>
          hill; at Christmas the mummers acted their dumb show;<br/>

          at Harvest time the God was worshipped in the<br/>
          sheaf of corn; how thxmXmxmxmmxmx the God was in the<br/>
          
            bay (ay) tree--how in the dances and songs that 
            children (childre) sing<br/>
          the old Gods were worshipped, and served. In these dressings<br/>

            something (tjing); to act in their own persons the inner joy; to make<br/>
          something which had no reason, no use. The

          that though 
            the (t e e) actors, presumably because they slipped<br/>

          despised, yet the great had so much of the common desire<br/>

            minstrels (minstresl), 
            their (ther)<br/>
          dancers and singers. Even the Church, conscious as the<br/>
          
            priests (preists) were that it was not 
            their God (theirGod) but some pagan<br/>
          
            who (wh) was thus 
            honoured (hinoured), could not suppress the minstrels and<br/>
          and the rhymers, the mummers, the jugglers, the bear leaders<br/>
          who came into the village, who acted

          parts in the churchyard.
