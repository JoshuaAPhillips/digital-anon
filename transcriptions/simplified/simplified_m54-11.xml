          there is a jolt at the points; the mind slides onto another<br/>
          rail, lovely as the words are. To speak them the poet has<br/>
          separated himself from the actors. He cannot yet make <br/>
           speak those words. The play is still 
            mainly (manly) the work<br/>
          of the undifferentiated audience, demanding great names,<br/>
          great deeds; simple outlines; and not the single subtlety<br/>
          of one soul.

          For the play itself was still anonymous. The lack of Marlowes<br/>
          name is by 
            itself (itslef) enough to show how largely the play was<br/>
          a common product, written by one hand, but so moulded<br/>
          in transition from actor to 
            actor (acotr) that the author had no<br/>
          sense of property in it. It was half the work of the audience.<br/>
          Yet the audience is dumb. The silence of the audience is<br/>
          one of the deep gulfs that lies between us and the 
            Elizabethan (Eliza)<br/>
          Elizabethan (bethan) play. The audience was a large one. Fifteen<br/>
          hundred people, Dr Greg computes, was an average 
            attendance (attanedance).<br/>
          Their presence, in the penny part of the house, is obvious.<br/>
          It draws 
            up (pup) the 
            hyperbole (hypberpole) as a sheet of paper<br/>
          draws 
            up (pup) fire. It makes the writer capable of great strides<br/>
          and vast audacities beyond his private reach. Yet the 
            audience (audiene)<br/>
          sits silent.

          To 
            understand (underdtand) the silence we must 
            compare (comapre) it<br/>
          with our own 
            attitude (attidtue) at the  at the <br/>
          in the early days. A new art comes upon us 
            so (si) 
            surprisingly (surprisningly)<br/>
          that we are silent, recognising something that we cannot<br/>
          measure. To <sup>the</sup> Elizabethans, the power of words after their<br/>
          long 
            silence (silnce) must have been overwhelming. There at the <br/>
          or at the  men and women who had never seen themselves<br/>
          whose only reading was 
            history or (historyor) sermon or some old 
            chronicle (chornicle)<br/>
