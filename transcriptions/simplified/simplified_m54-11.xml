          there is a jolt at the points; the mind slides onto another
          rail, lovely as the words are. To speak them the poet has
          separated himself from the actors. He cannot yet make 
           speak those words. The play is still 
            manly (mainly) the work
          of the undifferentiated audience, demanding great names,
          great deeds; simple outlines; and not the single subtlety
          of one soul.
        </p>

          For the play itself was still anonymous. The lack of Marlowes
          name is by 
            itslef (itself) enough to show how largely the play was
          a common product, written by one hand, but so moulded
          in transition from actor to 
            acotr (actor) that the author had no
          sense of property in it. It was half the work of the audience.
          Yet the audience is dumb. The silence of the audience is
          one of the deep gulfs that lies between us and the 
            Eliza (Elizabethan)
          bethan (Elizabethan) play. The audience was a large one. Fifteen
          hundred people, Dr Greg computes, was an average 
            attanedance (attendance).
          Their presence, in the penny part of the house, is obvious.
          It draws 
            pup (up) the 
            hypberpole (hyperbole) as a sheet of paper
          draws 
            pup (up) fire. It makes the writer capable of great strides
          and vast audacities beyond his private reach. Yet the 
            audiene (audience)
          sits silent.
