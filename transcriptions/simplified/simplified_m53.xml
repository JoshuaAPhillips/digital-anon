          @@@@@@@@@@@@@@
          For many centuries 
            aft (after) Britain became an island
          the  says, the untamed forest was king.
          On the matted boughs of that forest innumerable birds sang;
          but their song was only heard by a few skin clad hunters
          in the clearings. Did the desire to sing come to one
          of those savages because he heard the birds sing? <sup>&amp; did</sup><s>Did he</s>
          rest his stone axe against a tree for a moment? <sup>[illeg.]</sup> The tree
          was felled; some sort of hut 
            ws (was) made from its branches, and
          then by degrees, the clearing became larger; the birds
          fewer; and the human voice sung instead. <sup>&amp;</sup> The first songs
          are out of door songs; spring songs; summer songs; winter
          songs. <sup>&amp;</sup> for there was no comfort 
            indoor (indoors), little
          light and no books.
        </p>
        <p facs="">
          The eye therefore was xxxx more acti<sup>v</sup>e in the first sxxxxxxx
          singers than in ourselves. And some parts of 
            Englab (England)
          can still be seen as they saw it. Now and then by choosing
          a view carefully to shut out a chimney or a 
            bungalwo (bungalow),
          we can still see a flat fen, reed whispering, waterlogged;
          or a down, covered w still with turf only <s>And over</s><sup>But on</sup> the
          down lies a green scar, along which the travellers came,
          with the pack horses, dressed in wool, not in skins,

          the common voice, singing out of doors. He has no house.
          He has a quick eye. connected, for the eye is a youthful
          sense, with the body, with colour, with substance, rather
          than with the mind. He lives a 
            romaning (roaming) life, going from
          house to house, stopping oftener at the back door than at
          the front. He crosses the fields, mounts the hills, and
          lies down on the grassy 
            roa  (road) by the hawthorn to listen to
          the nightingale.

          By choosing a 
            vuew (view) carefully to shut out a chimney or a
          bungalow we can still see what  saw-- the bird haunted
          reed whispering fen; the down covered with turf, and the
          scar long healed over the moor, over the down, along which
           came when he made his journeys. He was
          for the most part a simple singer, lifting a song or story
          from other peoples lips, and letting the <sup>audience</sup> country people
          join in the chorus. But now and again <sup/>hxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmx
          he made a few lines <sup>himself</sup> that exactly corresponded to his emotion.
          He was an artist.

          The writer, who is distinct from the minstrel, whose words

          For when familiar

          a name, he is still

          wholly musician or wholly painter. It seems possible that
          the great English art may not be the art of words. He sees

          stimulated by the 
            ouns (sounds) of words spoken aloud. He must make
          words 
            sornours (sonorous), 
            rhytm (rhythm) obvious. since they are to <sup>read</sup>

          their own verses to the poem. But the book that had given

          and done the business of their estates. That 
            audeince (audience) at
          once began to exert its pressure. What is the book that will
          please my patron ? What is the theme that
          will recommend itself to ? Whom must I praise, whom
          may I satirise? At once come into existence some of

          As the book goes out into a

          these influences become more and more complex. According to
          its

          <sup>The play</sup>  was anonymous. That fact is by itself
          enough to show largely how the play was a common product,
          written by one hand, but so moulded in 
            tranition (transition) from the
          written to the spoken that the author had no sense of
          property in it. It was half the work of the audience. <sup> But</sup>
          yet the audience is 
            sdumb (dumb). That silence is one of 
            th (the) deep
          gulfs that lies between us and the 
            Elizabetahn (Elizabethan) play.
          Fifteen hundred people, Dr 
            Greg (Greg) says, hexmxxx
          went to the play, for the most part, presumably,
          in the penny part of the house, And <s>these</s> <sup>T</sup>he presence
          
            o (of) these apprentices, soldiers and citizens is obvious.
          It draws up the extravagance the hyperbole as a sheet of
          paper draws up a fire. It causes that glow that speed that
          audacity which make the writer capable of great strides and
          vast audacities beyond his private reach. Yet the
          audience says nothing . It makes no comment. It sits silent.
        </p>
        <p facs="">
          To understand that silence 
            w (we) must compare it
        </p>

          with 
            theour (our) own attitude say at the 
             ballet
          or at the 
             in their early days. A new art comes upon us
          so suddenly, so 
            surprisningly (surprisingly) that we are silent,
          recognising something true, which we <sup>recognise but</sup> cannot measure.
          To the Elizabethans, after the long silence of England,
          the <sup>hidden</sup> power of words to say what was in them must have been
          overwhelming. After ages of of scattered hints, a few
          wild songs, here and there a 
            chornicle (chronicle) or a 
            hitsiry (history), they
          suddenly came <sup>to [illeg.]</sup> out into the open and saw human life as it is
          at this moment. They saw themselves. It is a curious inversion
          We <s>see</s> realise the blood flesh and blood of the Elizabethans
          because we see it in the 
            r fl cted (reflected) in the drama.
          We neither see nor hear them in person; we 
            s ee (see) and hear
          them in the reflection. But if the audience sat silent
          as they saw 
            themslves (themselves) there on the stage between the
          stews, they <sup>but</sup> they saw themselves with rapture. Again and again
          the  protested against the intoxication
          that was 
            b rewed (brewed) in the Playhouse. The attraction was
          irresistible. There at the Rose, at the  at the 
          men and women who had
            neverseen (never seen) 
            themslves (themselves) yet, whose only
          
            readung (reading) was 
            histoy (history) or sermons, or some old
            chonicle (chronicle) of
          Knights and ladies, , and perhaps could not even read,
          but spent all their days struggling, loving, 
            chaeting (cheating),
          burrowing in the little festering streets 
            rounf (round) ,
          saw their very own lives composed, 
            adoredn (adored), and heard at
          
            kast (last) 
            thier (their) dreams their 
            aspriarions (aspirations) their satires their
          profanities spoken out loud in poetry.

          The play then owes its extravagance, and its riot,
          and its plot and its glow to the 
            audie ce (audience) in the penny seats.
