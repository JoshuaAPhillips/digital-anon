          "For many centuries afte (after) Britain became an island" the
           says "#"the untamed forest was king. Its moist
          and mossy floor was hidden from Heavens eye by a close drawn
          curtain woven of innumerable tree tops." On those matted
          boughs innumerable birds sang; but their song was only heard
          by a few skin clad hunters in the lcearings (clearings). Did the desire
          to sing come to one of those huntsmen because he heard the
          birds sing, and so rested his axe against the tree for a
          moment? But the tree had to be felled; and a hut made
          from its branches before the human voice sang too.
