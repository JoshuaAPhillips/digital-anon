          a certain

          something further. It is this that lures the<br/>

            perpetual (perp tual) curiosity. He does not as so many<br/>
          writers feed momentary 
            appetites (appettites). The 
            reader (resder) who has a dash<br/>
          of the writer in him, seeks out certain styles; certain<br/>
          forms. But 
            Shakespeare (Shakespere) has 
            no such (nosuch) appeal to the reader-writer.<br/>
          His styles are too 
            innumerable (innumerabel) 
            Perhaps (Perhpas) then he is chiefly<br/>
          used for more general 
            purposes (piposes)--when the ink has gone dry<br/>
          upon the pen to revive the sense of 
            language (langauge); or to<br/>
          testify, when words seem 
            motionless (motiinless), to the enormous<br/>
          possibilities of speed. One reading always supersedes another<br/>
          Thus the 
            truest (trueest) account of reading 
            Shakespeare (Shakespere) would be<br/>
          not to write a book with a beginning middle and end;<br/>
          but to collect notes, without trying to make them<br/>

          No one protests that here is an upstart writer who is<br/>

          The Elizabethan audience were not readers. They had to<br/>
          draw in the play as they sat or stood at the playhouse,<br/>

          This perhaps

          It accounts too for the long pause <sup>between [sixteenth? seventeenth?] &amp; the 18th centuries</sup> when the plays of<br/>
          
             even hang suspended and unrealised. It was only<br/>
          when <sup>they had to [wait?]</sup> they were printed and the book of the words lay in many<br/>
          private rooms txxxx <sup>before they</sup> received their other life from<br/>
          the reader. Much that was lost in the 
            playhouse (playhous e) was<br/>
          discovered in the private room. But much has also been lost <sup>, when the </sup><br/>
          We have lost the sound of the spoken word; all that the<br/>
          sight of the actors body gives through the eye to the mind.<br/>
          We have lost too the sense of being part of the audience.<br/>
          We miss a thousand shades that the

            play (p ay) with our<br/>
          impression after reading the play. But as the modern actor<br/>
          inevitably imports much that is of his own day, but foreign<br/>
          to 
            Shakespeare (Shshakespeare), there is still something sunk beyond
