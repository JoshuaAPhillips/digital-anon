          The printing press brought the past into existence.<br/>
          It brought into existence the man who is conscious of the 
            past (pat)<br/>
          the man who sees his time, zzzzz against a back ground of<br/>
          the past; the man who firsts sees himself and shows himself<br/>
          to us. xmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmmm The first<br/>
          blow has been aimed at  when the authors name is attached<br/>
          to the book. The 
            individual (indivi al) emerges. His name is ;<br/>
          his 
            name (mae) is also . Harrison emerging from the past<br/>
          tells us that he has a library; that he owns a mastiff;<br/>
          that he digs up Roman coins. He tells us that he has never (nev) 
              been (ben)<br/>
          more than forty miles from  in . Anon is<br/>
          losing his ambiguity. The present is becoming visible.<br/>
          Harrison sees the pxmxmxmxmsx the present 
            against (agains) the<br/>
          settled 
            recorded (reroded) past. The past looks 
            degenerate (degnerate), raw,<br/>
          against that past.

          Upstairs in the great room , as he tells us, "our ancient<br/>
          ladies of the court" were to be found reading the<br/>
          Greeks and the Latins. as they sat at their needlework.<br/>
          And the 
            scholars (sch;ars) in the 
            college (c ege) library were reading the<br/>
          classics that were chained to the 
            shelves (shlves) in the<br/>
          college libraries. He turned away from the actors who<br/>
          even while he dug up 
            coins (voins) in his garden were acting their<br/>
          crude

          common people were still at their lewd practises.
