          The printing press brought the past into existence.
          It brought into existence the man who is conscious of the 
            pat (past)
          the man who sees his time, zzzzz against a back ground of
          the past; the man who firsts sees himself and shows himself
          to us. xmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmmm The first
          blow has been aimed at  when the authors name is attached
          to the book. The 
            indivi al (individual) emerges. His name is ;
          his 
            mae (name) is also . Harrison emerging from the past
          tells us that he has a library; that he owns a mastiff;
          that he digs up Roman coins. He tells us that he has nev (never) 
              ben (been)
          more than forty miles from  in . Anon is
          losing his ambiguity. The present is becoming visible.
          Harrison sees the pxmxmxmxmsx the present 
            agains (against) the
          settled 
            reroded (recorded) past. The past looks 
            degnerate (degenerate), raw,
          against that past.

          Upstairs in the great room , as he tells us, "our ancient
          ladies of the court" were to be found reading the
          Greeks and the Latins. as they sat at their needlework.
          And the 
            sch;ars (scholars) in the 
            c ege (college) library were reading the
          classics that were chained to the 
            shlves (shelves) in the
          college libraries. He turned away from the actors who
          even while he dug up 
            voins (coins) in his garden were acting their
          crude 
            darams (dramas) in the market place. Hxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxmxm
