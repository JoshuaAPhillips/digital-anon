          But at some point there comes a break when anonymity

            abosrbed (absorbed) the 
            contrbution (contribution) of the audience; and returns it

          It was <sup>a </sup> losing its light; it was <s>svere</s> <sup>severe</sup> <s>and</s> stone xxxxx
          blue. The shadow crept over Bartholomews face. He looked
          leafless, spectral. As a dog shudders its skin, his skin
          shuddered. He rose, shook himself, glared at nothing,
          and stalked from the room. They hard the  paws padding
          on the carpet behind him.

          Now we note the beauty of the words.
          But often it is a suspended, derelict beauty. Chaos 
            inter (intervenes)
          
            venes (intervenes). The 
            rl ation (relation) of part to part is outraged.
          The balance is imperfect. Here is profusion; there bareness.
          The 
            anony ous (anonymous) playwright is irresponsible. He cares nothing
          has no conscieince about truth; he cares only for the plot.
          We are left in the end without an end. The emotion is e
          wasted.
