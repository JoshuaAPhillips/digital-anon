          The play then owes its hyperbole to the audience in the<br/>

          Anonymity was a great possession. It gave the early<br/>

          But at some point there comes a break when anonymity<br/>
          withdraws. It comes presumably when the

            absorbed (abosrbed) the 
            contribution (contrbution) of the audience; and returns it<br/>

          The darkness had 
            increased (incrased), and it was cold. With a little<br/>
          shiver, Mrs Swithin drew her sequin 
            shawl (shalw) about hew shoulders<br/>
          She was too deep in the story to ask for the window to be<br/>
          shut. "London" said the author "
            was (a s) then a swamp...
          
            Thick groves of trees covered the land, and on the top<br/>
            oftheir matted branches, birds sang..."

          The great square of the window showed only sky now.<br/>
          It was <sup>a </sup> losing its light; it was <s>svere</s> <sup>severe</sup> <s>and</s> stone xxxxx<br/>
          blue. The shadow crept over Bartholomews face. He looked<br/>
          leafless, spectral. As a dog shudders its skin, his skin<br/>
          shuddered. He rose, shook himself, glared at nothing,<br/>
          and stalked from the room. They hard the  paws padding<br/>
          on the carpet behind him.

          Lucy turned the page quickly, guiltily,<br/>

          Now we note the beauty of the words.<br/>
          But often it is a suspended, derelict beauty. Chaos 
            intervenes (inter)<br/>
          
            intervenes (venes). The 
            relation (rl ation) of part to part is outraged.<br/>
          The balance is imperfect. Here is profusion; there bareness.<br/>
          The 
            anonymous (anony ous) playwright is irresponsible. He cares nothing<br/>
          has no conscieince about truth; he cares only for the plot.<br/>
          We are left in the end without an end. The emotion is e<br/>
          wasted.

          But 
            gradually (graudally) the mist withdraws. So many

          are 
            exploring (explroing) So many private people are pressing up<br/>
