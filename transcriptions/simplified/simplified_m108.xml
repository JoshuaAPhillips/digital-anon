            <p>These and successive folders of [The Reader] were contained in two multigrip folders, headed by Virginia Woolf: "Turning the page"; "Transformations" and "Spare sheets of T.P." labels on the spines. They are filed under her Anon, holograph and typescript fragments.</p>
            <p>The fragments grouped in the successive folders under [The reader] may or may not have formed part of Anon. They have been grouped in this fashion based on the evidence of paper and typewriters. The pagination 23-28 is the lowest in the sequence. Internal evidence would indicate that manuscript drafts preceded that of Anon, since Articles, 1938-9 notebook contains a fragment. Some of the versos of this run of material contains fragments of typescripts of Between the Acts and other contemporary works.</p>

          There is a jolt at the points. Lovely as the words are,
          the mind slides on to a another rail. To speak them the poet
          has separated t himself from the 
            actirs (actors). He cannot yet make
           speak those words with his own lips. The play
          is still in part the work of the 
            undiffrenetiated (undifferentiated) audience,
          demanding great names, great deeds, simple outlines,

          That 
            sielnce (silence) is one of the deep gulfs that lies between us
          and the play. They come

          but they nxmxmxx sit there silent. They neither

          a press that at once applies a standard, the Elizabethans

          the expressive power of words after their 
            lo g (long) inadequacy

          The proper topics of 
            discccuion (discussion) in the 
            pper (upper)
          world was not the Play at

          "Of Truth. Of Death. Of Unity in religion. Of Revenge.
          Of Simulation and 
            Dissumlation (Dissimulation)." These were the subjects
          that the rulers discussed at their high tables;
          and the play was a diversion with which to relax the mind
          after serious work. The sediment of that conversation is
          to be found in the rich deposits of the essays. He is concern
          with the great world of action; with government; with the
          tortuous matures of Princes; with the arts by which Princes
          can

          in the world of great spirits and great business. The common

          The soul that walked between delicate groves, now
          and then formulating a 
            pharse (phrase) to be taken down by the 
            y ng (young)
          secretary , kept to a narrow path between
          hedges. While  ranged

            curisoities (curiosities), mixing 
            garrul usly (garrulously) with every one, Bacon kept
          to the narrow path. Yet even in the shade his thought
          is embodied. His deep meditations are given concrete form.
          
            "Nay retire men 
              acnnot (cannot) when they would: neither will they
            when it were reason; but are 
              impateint (impatient) of privateness
            even in age and sickness which require the Shadow: Like old
            Townmen that will be still sitting at their street door,

          Bacons contempt was for hyperbole; not for the art of
          speech. He was teaching the ranting players to speak
          slowly, closely, subtly. He was proving that there is 
            anothe (another)
          kind of poetry, the poetry of prose. He was bringing the
          prose of the mind into being. And thus by increasing the
          range of the poet, bu making it possible for him to express
          more, he was making an end of anonymity.
