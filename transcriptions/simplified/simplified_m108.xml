          There is a jolt at the points. Lovely as the words are,<br/>
          the mind slides on to a another rail. To speak them the poet<br/>
          has separated t himself from the 
            actors (actirs). He cannot yet make<br/>
           speak those words with his own lips. The play<br/>
          is still in part the work of the 
            undifferentiated (undiffrenetiated) audience,<br/>
          demanding great names, great deeds, simple outlines,<br/>
          and not the single subtlety of one soul.

          That 
            silence (sielnce) is one of the deep gulfs that lies between us<br/>
          and the play. They come 
            crowding (crodwing) across the river daily;<br/>
          but they nxmxmxx sit there silent. They neither 
            praise (priasise)<br/>

            silence (siel ce) with our own d<br/>
          silence at the  or at the  in their<br/>
          early days. A new art comes upon us so surprisingly<br/>
          that we sit silent,

          a press that at once applies a standard, the Elizabethans<br/>
          had no literature behind them to with which to compare the<br/>
          play, and no press to give it speech. To the 
            Elizabethans (Elizabeathsn)<br/>
          the expressive power of words after their 
            long (lo g) inadequacy<br/>
          must have been overwhelming. Silence must have kept them<br/>
          silent. There at the  or at the  men and women whose<br/>
          only reading had been the Bible or some old 
            chronicle (chornicle)<br/>

            themselves (themsleves) 
            splendidly (sple didly) dressed. They heard them selves saying<br/>

          aspirations, their profanities, their ribaldries<br/>

          illicit in their pleasure. The preacher and the magistrate<br/>

          The play then owes its <sup>heightened</sup> intensity to the audience in the<br/>

          and the play was a diversion with which to relax the mind<br/>
          after serious work. The sediment of that conversation is<br/>
          to be found in the rich deposits of the essays. He is concern<br/>
          with the great world of action; with government; with the<br/>
          tortuous matures of Princes; with the arts by which Princes<br/>
          can 
            sway (way), can coax, can suppress. He lives entirely<br/>
          in the world of great spirits and great business. The common<br/>
          
            people (peopl) is contemptible. The master of superstition is<br/>
          
            the (t e) people." Praise, "if it be from the common people,
          
            it is commonly false and naught. The lowest virtues draw<br/>
            praise from them; the middle virtues work in them astonish

          The soul that walked between delicate groves, now<br/>
          and then formulating a 
            phrase (pharse) to be taken down by the 
            young (y ng)<br/>
          secretary , kept to a narrow path between<br/>
          hedges. While  ranged 
            the (th) world, 
            indulging (indulgn) all<br/>
          
            curiosities (curisoities), mixing 
            garrulously (garrul usly) with every one, Bacon kept<br/>
          to the narrow path. Yet even in the shade his thought<br/>
          is embodied. His deep meditations are given concrete form.<br/>
          
            "Nay retire men 
              cannot (acnnot) when they would: neither will they<br/>
            when it were reason; but are 
              impatient (impateint) of privateness<br/>
            even in age and sickness which require the Shadow: Like old<br/>
            Townmen that will be still sitting at their street door,
          
          though thereby they offer Age to scorn." Even in the <br/>
           thought 
            is (ic) coloured. The Colours that show best<br/>
          by candlelight , are: White, Carnation, and a kinde of<br/>
          Sea-Water Green". It only needs the playwright to put <sup>one push for their thoughts</sup><br/>
          flesh and blood onto his thoughts. <sup>to become [people?]</sup>

          Bacons contempt was for hyperbole; not for the art of<br/>
          speech. He was teaching the ranting players to speak<br/>
          slowly, closely, subtly. He was proving that there is 
            another (anothe)<br/>
          kind of poetry, the poetry of prose. He was bringing the<br/>
          prose of the mind into being. And thus by increasing the<br/>
          range of the poet, bu making it possible for him to express<br/>
          more, he was making an end of anonymity.
