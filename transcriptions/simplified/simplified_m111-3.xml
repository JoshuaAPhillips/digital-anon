          Anonymity was a great possession. It gave the early writing<br/>
          an impersonality, a generality. It gave us the 
            ballads (ballds);<br/>
          it gave us the songs. It allowed us to know 
            nothing (notning) of the<br/>
          writer; and so to concentrate upon his song.  had<br/>
          great 
            privileges (privilges). He was not responsible. He was not self<br/>
          conscious. He is not self conscious. He can borrow. He can<br/>
          repeat. He can say what every one feels. No 
            one (ne) tries to<br/>
          stamp his own name, to 
            discover (disover) his own 
            experience (expereince), in his<br/>
          work. He keeps at a distance from the present moment.<br/>
          Anon the lyric poet repeats over and over again<br/>
          that flowers fade; that death is the 
            end (ned). He is 
            never (nver) tired<br/>
          of celebrating red roses and white breasts. The anonymous<br/>
          playwright has like the singer this 
            nameless (namless) vitality,<br/>
          something drawn from the crowd in the penny seats and not yet<br/>
          dead in ourselves. We can still become anonymous and forget<br/>
          something that we have learnt when we read the plays to which<br/>
          no one has troubled to set a name.

            some (asome) point there comes a break when anonymity<br/>

          the 
            contribution (contrbution) of the audience; and can return to them<br/>

          We can suppose that the reading public was brought into<br/>

        The <s>life</s> The reader then is born sometime in<br/>
        the

        but his 
          power (p wer) of influencing the playwright is very weak<br/>

          instinctively (instinctivly) tries to adapt himself<br/>
        to unfamiliar conditions in reading the earlier plays.<br/>
        He tries to supply the trumpets and the flags; the citizens<br/>

        the sunk parts of the play;  <s>he labours</s> to revive<br/>
        the vanished cooperation between the playwright and the<br/>
        audience. And he is perpetually rebuffed. He cannot<br/>
        read the play into 
          complete (comlete) being. He is therefore apt<br/>
        to become not a reader but a student, a careful<br/>
        collector of scattered bones. Reading is an imperfect<br/>
        way of bringing the early plays into existence. It is only<br/>
        fitfully that the readers faculty comes into play.<br/>
        When the dramatist becomes 
          conscious (consc ous) of the play as a work<br/>
        of art; when he is able to unite the play by something<br/>
        in himself-- his 
          personality (personal ty), his style, his conception<br/>
        it is then that he brings the reader into existence.
