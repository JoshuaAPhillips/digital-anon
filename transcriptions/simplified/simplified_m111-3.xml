          Anonymity was a great possession. It gave the early writing
          an impersonality, a generality. It gave us the 
            ballds (ballads);
          it gave us the songs. It allowed us to know

            disover (discover) his own 
            expereince (experience), in his
          work. He keeps at a distance from the present moment.

          something drawn from the crowd in the penny seats and not yet
          dead in ourselves. We can still become anonymous and forget
          something that we have learnt when we read the plays to which

        but his

          personal ty (personality), his style, his conception
        it is then that he brings the reader into existence.

        The life history of the reader from Elizabethan
        times to our own is full of obscurity. At some point his
