          This brittle and imperfect sketch with its

          We can suppose that the reading public came into existence
          some four hundred years ago when the playhouse was shut.
          But the reading public must have been a small one, composed
          of scholars and aristocrats. The lack of 
            gneral (general) reading
          accounts for the long pause between  death
          in 
            an (and) the 
            i8th (18th) century when the plays of 
            Shakeperea (Shakespeare) hung
          
            sus ended (suspended), unrealised. They had to wait until the plays
          were open on 
            manyprivate (many private) tables 
            nbefore (before) they received the other life that the reader confers,
          the detached, the 
            particualr (particular). The smallness of the reading
          public and its specialised nature accounts for the scarcity
          of 
            criti icism (criticism), and for the general nature of what
          criticism there was. Both  and  deal
          with the xmxmxmxxx theory of poetry and not with the
          
            artciual ([actual?]) poem, are writing for the little public of
          scholars and aristocrats and deal with the <sup>general</sup> questions of 
            inter (interest)

            particualr (particular) 
            questoons (questions) that 
            interst (interest) the public. The 
            gneral (general) public was not asking for
          
            co ment (comment) or 
            cticism (criticism). Wi They had to draw in the play with
          their eyes and their ears. They

          words they could not deepen and revise the impression

          are answered in every newspaper.

          The readers faculty is a queer one. He has the power to
          make houses and countries visible, men and women and their
          thoughts and emotions, from marks on a printed page.
          He is not a scholar and so lacks many props, many
          special tastes that control <sup>[anticipate?]</sup>, and direct.
          He has a sensibility that millions of perfectly
          literate people, who 'read' the paper, are without.
