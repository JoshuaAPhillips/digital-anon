          This brittle and imperfect sketch with its 
            exaggerations (exggerations) and<br/>
          foreshortenings, is no more than an attempt to point out<br/>
            and the  to a<br/>
          
            visitor (visiotr) 
            from (f om) the 
            country (co ntry). You will complain 
            justly (jystly) that it<br/>
          
            it (ti) leaves out 
            the (th e) effect of those famous 
            monuments (monumtnts) upon the<br/>
          emotions. Thxmxmxmxmxmxmmxmxmxmxx To 
            transmit (trasnmit) that<br/>
          emotion let us now 
            attempt (attenot) a dangerous 
            transition (transiti n);<br/>
          from one attitude to another, from the<br/>
          The emotion which built them, the emotion which they still<br/>
          transmit is left out. This 
            is a (sia) charge that can be 
            levelled (levlled)<br/>
          against all criticism. xmxmxxx a charge easy enough to<br/>
          xxxxxx Take as a simple example of the<br/>
          difficulties of transmitting emotion, the 
            need (ned) of making<br/>
          
            quotation (q otation). The page has to be found and the words copied.<br/>
          The manual act disturbs the st current of thought<br/>
          The presence of alien bodies is also clearly 
            perceptible (percebtile).<br/>
          Many people have spent lives in 
            museums (musumes), in order to<br/>
          verify one date. Accuracy then is 
            demanded (d manded).<br/>
          In view of these obstacles, the 
            transition (trasntion) 
            from (fron) the critical<br/>
          attitude to the private is 
            attended (attende) with great dangers.<br/>
          We have to free 
            ourselves (ourslves) from the imposition of authority<br/>
          the dominion of the customary. In short we have to 
            transport (tranport)<br/>
          
            ourselves (ourslves) from the critics 
            attitude (attutude); to the f<br/>
          readers, even perhaps to the state of mind<br/>
          is so amorphous that it has no visible<br/>
          the readers; 
            we (w) have to become

          We can suppose that the reading public came into existence<br/>
          some four hundred years ago when the playhouse was shut.<br/>
          But the reading public must have been a small one, composed<br/>
          of scholars and aristocrats. The lack of 
            general (gneral) reading<br/>
          accounts for the long pause between  death<br/>
          in 
            and (an) the 
            18th (i8th) century when the plays of 
            Shakespeare (Shakeperea) hung<br/>
          
            suspended (sus ended), unrealised. They had to wait until the plays<br/>
          were open on 
            many private (manyprivate) tables 
            before (nbefore) they received the other life that the reader confers,<br/>
          the detached, the 
            particular (particualr). The smallness of the reading<br/>
          public and its specialised nature accounts for the scarcity<br/>
          of 
            criticism (criti icism), and for the general nature of what<br/>
          criticism there was. Both  and  deal<br/>

          t to them, not with the 
            particular (particualr) 
            questions (questoons) that 
            interest (interst) the public. The 
            general (gneral) public was not asking for<br/>
          
            comment (co ment) or 
            criticism (cticism). Wi They had to draw in the play with<br/>
          their eyes and their ears. They 
            Without (Wothout) a book of the<br/>
          words they could not deepen and revise the impression<br/>
          
            left (lfet) by the play, or ask those questions that in our day<br/>
          are answered in every newspaper.

            Elizabethan (Elizabthan) 
            clothes (cloth s) have had too much<br/>
          attention from the 
            historical (historival) 
            novelist (novelst), and too little<br/>
          from the psychologist. What desire was it that<br/>
          prompted this 
            extraordinary (extraodrinady) display? There must have been<br/>
          some protest, some desire to affirm something, behind the<br/>
          slashed cloaks; the stiff ruffs; the wrought chains<br/>
          and the loops of pearls. The cost was great; the discomfort<br/>
          appaling; yet the fashion prevailed. Was it perhaps,<br/>
          the mark of an 
            anonymous (uannymous), 
            unrecorded (unreorded) age to enforce the<br/>
          
            individual (indivisual); to make ones ones physical body as bright,<br/>
          as definite, as marked as possible? Fame must be 
            concentrated (concentrate)<br/>
          in the body; since the other kind of fame, the publicity<br/>
          of the paper, of the pxmxmxx photograph, was 
            denied (d nied) them.<br/>
          Did the

          The Elizabethans are silent. There is no little 
            language (languag)<br/>
          nothing brief, intimate, 
            colloquial (collqouial). When they write<br/>
          the
