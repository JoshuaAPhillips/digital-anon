          must in order to sit and stand there, while the sun beats<br/>
          or the rain pours have some strong inducement; something<br/>
          that puzzles; and then concludes. They must have love;<br/>
          murder; adultery. And this 
            contribution (contrbution) of the audience<br/>
          was more unfortunate to the dramatist 
            than (tahn) to the lyric<br/>
          singer. Often the actions is too violent for the words.<br/>
          There is a dislocation between the thought and the action.<br/>
          No one feels what is said. The emotion is often<br/>
          
            plastered (las ered) on to a dumb figure. But if violence rapidity<br/>
          movement are dictated by the audience an inevitable 
            confusion (confusin)<br/>
          follows. On the other hand the playwright<br/>
          like the singer has an anomymous vitality,<br/>
          drawn 
            from (fro) other bodies, a 
            perennial (pe renniel) common vigour.<br/>
          Nor is  
            dead (dad) in ourselves. The crude early 
            dramas (ddrams)<br/>
          have still the power to make us ask--as the audience asked--<br/>
          the childs 
            question (questin): what comes next? <sup>a power denied to [20th?] century [illeg.]</sup><br/>
          So we become 
            ourselves (ourelves) anonymous in the early plays.

          It is only later when the pressure of silent 
            hoarded (horaded)<br/>
          emotion had thrown up words, as the 
            fingers (fi gers) of the man at the<br/>
           casts letters from the bubbling lead,<br/>
          that we lose this general quality to gain---<br/>
          everything it seems. For the 
            curtain (curatin) goes on rising<br/>
          incessantly for fifty years. Now it rises on ;<br/>
          then on ; on ;<br/>
          on ; finally on . 
            By (Byt) that time the sxxgxx<br/>
          play has outgrown the stage. The stage has become too small<br/>
          to act this drama. Perhaps after 
            centuries (cnuries), the play will<br/>
          come to birth again, differently, in ,<br/>
          in . But the play never again fitted the stage
