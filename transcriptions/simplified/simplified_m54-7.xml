          For when familiar 
            letters (lettres) are written in Biblical prose<br/>
          there must be a barrier between what is sayable and what<br/>
          unsayable. There is a limit to what can be put<br/>
          into words. He cannot talk; he cannot sing. <sup>[illeg.]</sup> At the beginning<br/>
          of the sixteenth

          given him a name; but he is still unspecialised.<br/>

          , to state, rather than to take part, is not yet wholly<br/>
          writer, wholly musician or 
            wholly (whllly) painter. It seems possible<br/>
          that the great English art 
            may (ma) not be the art of words.<br/> 
          He still has the exact 
            observant (observan) eye <sup>that sees exactly </sup>; his ear is stimulated<br/>
          by the sound of words spoken aloud. His words must have body<br/>
          and 
            substance (substnace), <sup>H</sup>e must make them <sup>words</sup> 
            sonorous (sornous), since they are to<br/>
