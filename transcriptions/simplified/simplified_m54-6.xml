          and the

          wxmxmxmxmxmxmx The 
            Elizabethans (Elizabthans) are 
            unknown (unknonw) to us<br/>
          because when they write 
            prose (rpose) txxxx the 
            rhythm (rhytm) of the Bible<br/>
          was in their ears. 
            It is a (Its ia) 
            garment (garemt) only to be worn when the<br/>
          mind is in the right 
            attitude (attidt de). It crushes out the<br/>
          simple, the 
            subtle (sublte), the 
            brief (breif). Their letters are state<br/>
          
            documents (documnets), intricate, involved, 
            circumlocutions (circum locutious).<br/>
          There is no gaiety, no freedom, no warmth in the great room.<br/>
          When Lady  writes to , she admonishes,<br/>
          she 
            exhorts (exhosrts). Greek and 
            Latin (atin) come as easily to her pen<br/>
          as a French phrase would come to ours. If she has to 
            descend (decsned) to an actual 
            object (o jsc t)-- a basket of 
            strawberries (strwberries)-- it w<br/>
          is 
            with (w   -th) dark 
            insinuations (insintuations). Fear of God and 
            suspicion (suspcicion)<br/>
          of man surround her as with the walls of a dungeon. The wall<br/>
          may conceal a Lady Ann who is merry and gay; it must<br/>
          conceal laughter, love, good humour, and all the trifles<br/>
          of daily life. But behind that stiff garment of Elizabethan<br/>
          prose who can tell what emotions are alive? They are<br/>
          
            pompous (pomous); they are 
            solemn (solmen); they are longwinded;<br/>
          We 
            know (lknow) nothing about the audience who saw the plays acted;<br/>
          we know 
            nothing (notning) about the public who had the books read aloud<br/>
          to them.
