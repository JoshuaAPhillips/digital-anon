          the pear shaped lute; on which the  herself once played
          But the Elizabethans themselves are silent. Only their

          remains, stiff, ornate, 
            fasntastic (fantastic) and uncushioned;
          and the 
            vardibgalls (vardingales) which roused the preachers wrath.

          wxmxmxmxmxmxmx The 
            Elizabthans (Elizabethans) are 
            unknonw (unknown) to us
          because when they write 
            rpose (prose) txxxx the 
            rhytm (rhythm) of the Bible
          was in their ears. 
            Its ia (It is a) 
            garemt (garment) only to be worn when the
          mind is in the right 
            attidt de (attitude). It crushes out the
          simple, the 
            sublte (subtle), the 
            breif (brief). Their letters are state
          
            documnets (documents), intricate, involved, 
            circum locutious (circumlocutions).
          There is no gaiety, no freedom, no warmth in the great room.
          When Lady  writes to , she admonishes,
          she 
            exhosrts (exhorts). Greek and 
            atin (Latin) come as easily to her pen
          as a French phrase would come to ours. If she has to 
            decsned (descend) to an actual 
            o jsc t (object)-- a basket of 
            strwberries (strawberries)-- it w
          is

            insintuations (insinuations). Fear of God and 
            suspcicion (suspicion)
          of man surround her as with the walls of a dungeon. The wall
          may conceal a Lady Ann who is merry and gay; it must
          conceal laughter, love, good humour, and all the trifles
          of daily life. But behind that stiff garment of Elizabethan
          prose who can tell what emotions are alive? They are
          
            pomous (pompous); they are 
            solmen (solemn); they are longwinded;
          We 
            lknow (know) nothing about the audience who saw the plays acted;
          we know 
            notning (nothing) about the public who had the books read aloud
          to them.
