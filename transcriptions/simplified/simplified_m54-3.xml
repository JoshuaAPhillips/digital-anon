          Both Harrison and Latimer see the very same house <sup>[The house was being?]</sup><br/>
          the 
            house (hose) that was being built on the foundations of the<br/>
          old house. We can still see the great Elizabethan house<br/>
          whose building was to both preacher and antiquary a<br/>
          sign of txmxmxmxmxmxmxmxxx luxury. in all its glory.<br/>
          There it is, standing in its green island of Park 
            separated (seapareted)<br/>
          often from the high road by only a 
            dip (d p) in the ground and a<br/>
          low red wall. With its 
            conglomeration (congloeration) of roofs and chapels<br/>
          and 
            chimneys (chimeys) 
            it (i) dwarfs its 
            neighbours (neighboyrs). Inside all is kept as<br/>
          if the Queen Elizabeth were expected. The upright 
            Elizabethan (Elizabetahn)<br/>
          chairs stand round the walls. Their 
            fittings (ftinges) and tapestry<br/>
          are not much faded. The great oak tables are heavy<br/>
          and polished. The 
            carved (carbed) chairs and cupboards look 
            brand (barnd)<br/>
          new. The floor is strewn with carpets; cut glass chandeliers<br/>
          hang down from the decorated

            ceiling (celing).<br/>

          Latimer had read the 
            Lord's (Lord) Prayer in English. The Bible<br/>
          was printed in English. And, using the prose of the bible<br/>
          when they write prose, the 
            Elizabethans (Elixabethans) are 
            unknown (unknwon) to us.<br/>
          When in some extremity of anguish or fear they take up the<br/>
          pen they use the 
            rhythms (rhyms) of the Bible. 
            It is (Itis) a garment only<br/>
