          a more crowded, a more divided audience, to a<br/>
          public which desires

          <s>mudcoloured</s>, the dismal in their own lives. As the book<br/>
          becomes more and more spun over with these influences,<br/>
          the thing that the writer has to say becomes increasingly cumbered. It is only to be discovered in a flash of<br/>
          recognition Thus some say they that their beards<br/>
          bristle when they come up on it; others that a thrill<br/>
          runs down the nerves of the thigh. To disengage the song<br/>
          from its encumbrances becomes as time

          He looks back to 
            ; he descends from 
            Chaucer (Cahucer).<br/>
          It was Chaucer that gave him the <s>
            measure (meausre)</s> <sup>
              standard (stabdard)</sup> by which to<br/>
          measure

            attacks (attackes) the<br/>
          actual works of some 
            one (on) of the generation that is just<br/>
          gone, making that book the kicking off point <sup>starting point</sup> in another<br/>
          direction,  revolt was against no 
            particular (particualr) writer<br/>
          ---had not years of silence intervened? <sup>who was there in English save ?</sup>--- but against the<br/>
          
            language (langauge) itself, its decay, since Chaucer, its corruption.<br/>
          It was partly as an antidote to his own facility; <s>that he</s><br/>
          <s>needed him</s>. He found the e 
            urge (ourge) which the self critical<br/>
          writer so often applies to his own disease in the old English<br/>
          words that were now obsolete. A glossary was added to the<br/>
           to explain them. But partly he used the<br/>
          crabbed, English of the past not as we in our day<br/>
          seek to bring back the sharpness which much use has worn<br/>
          smooth; but to restrain what was to come. He was, as we <sup>are not</sup><br/>
          <s>cannot be</s>, aware of the future. Everywhere, in 
            ballads (ballds),<br/>
          songs, talk in the street, at the tavern, at the back<br/>
