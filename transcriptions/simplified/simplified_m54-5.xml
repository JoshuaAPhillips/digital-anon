          becomes more and more spun over with these influences,
          the thing that the writer has to say becomes increasingly cumbered. It is only to be discovered in a flash of
          recognition Thus some say they that their beards
          bristle when they come up on it; others that a thrill
          runs down the nerves of the thigh. To disengage the song
          from its encumbrances becomes as time 
            gos (goes) on a task for

          He looks back to 
            ; he descends from 
            Cahucer (Chaucer).
          It was Chaucer that gave him the <s>
            meausre (measure)</s> <sup>
              stabdard (standard)</sup> by which to
          measure 
            hiw (his) own words. <sup>But</sup> Where the modern writer 
            attackes (attacks) the
          actual works of some 
            on (one) of the generation that is just
          gone, making that book the kicking off point <sup>starting point</sup> in another
          direction,  revolt was against no 
            particualr (particular) writer
          ---had not years of silence intervened? <sup>who was there in English save ?</sup>--- but against the
          
            langauge (language) itself, its decay, since Chaucer, its corruption.
          It was partly as an antidote to his own facility; <s>that he</s>
          <s>needed him</s>. He found the e 
            ourge (urge) which the self critical
          writer so often applies to his own disease in the old English
          words that were now obsolete. A glossary was added to the
           to explain them. But partly he used the
          crabbed, English of the past not as we in our day
          seek to bring back the sharpness which much use has worn
          smooth; but to restrain what was to come. He was, as we <sup>are not</sup>
          <s>cannot be</s>, aware of the future. Everywhere, in 
            ballds (ballads),
          songs, talk in the street, at the tavern, at the back
          door, he heard

            buursting (bursting) up
          from 
            beanth (beneath) <sup>[illeg.]</sup> the old exact words; the crabbed but precise
          language of Chaucer. Was it not <sup>[illeg.]</sup> to restrain that
