          Anonymity was a great possession. It gave the early
          plays <sup>writing</sup> a general nature.

            ballds (ballads); it gave

          He is not self conscious. He can borrow. He can repeat.
          He can say what everyone feels. No one asks that he shall
          stamp his own name on his work. He keeps at a distance from
          the present moment. Anon the lyric writer

          that no one troubled to set a name to.

          Later when the audience becomes critical, when the
          emotion in the audience becomes self 
            oncsious (conscious), when
          the country squire can say without quoting  what
          is in his mind, we lose this general quality to gain---

          become too small for the play. It has outgrown the uncovered
          theatre where 
            eh (the) sun beats and the rain pours. And the
          reader is born. He acts the play in the theatre of his own
          brain. Perhaps after centuries the play is born again,

          Each time it rises upon a more detached, a more matured
          drama. The 
            indivisual (individual) on the stage becomes more and more
          
            diife entiated (differentiated); and the whole group is more closely
          
            rleated (related) and less at the mercy of the lp plot. The curtain
          rises upon Hxmxmmxmx ; and ;

          Finally it rises upon the Tempest. But the play has outgrown
          the uncovered theatre where the 
            s n (sun) beats and the rain
          pours. That 
            thetare (theatre) must be replaced by the
          
            thestre (theatre) of the brain. The playwright is replaced by the man
          who writes a book. The audience is replaced by the reader.

          The audience at the 
            Elizabetahn (Elizabethan) play was not an 
            audiejce ()
          of readers. They had to draw 
            int (in) the play through their ears, through their eyes
          They could not deepen the impression and renew
          it at a table in a private room. This perhaps explains
          the scarcity of Elizabethan criticism; and the general nature
          of what criticism there is. Both  and 
          deal with the general rules of poetry; not with the 
            particuar (particular)
          play or poem. The lack of a book of the words accounts too
          for the long pause, between  death
          and the eighteenth century, 
            whe (when) the plays of 
            Shakepere (Shakespeare)
          even hang suspended, 
            unrea ised (unrealised). They had to wait until the
          printed book was in many hands before they received
          the life that the reader 
            co fers (confers) Much that was lost

            disocvered (discovered) in the private room.
          But

          Txmxmmxmxmxmxmmxmxmxmmxmxmxmxmxm We have lost the sound of the
          spoken word; all that the sight of the actors bodies
          suggests to the mind through the eye. We have lost the
          sense of being part of the audience. We miss a 
            th usnd (thousand)
          suggestions that the dramatist conveyed by the inflection
          of voice, by gesture, by the placing of the actors bodies.
          This can still be proved by comparing our impression
          
            aft (after) seeing the play acted with our impression after reading
          the play alone. But as the actor 
            ipmports (imports) much that is of
          his own day, and 
            foreing ([foreign?]) to the past, so that there is t
          still something in every Elizabethan play sunk beyond recall.

          Presumably the earlier plays, in which the playwright
          and the audience were mxxxx in closer cooperation, are the
          more damaged by reading them. The reader 
            instinctivly (instinctively) tries
          to be there in person. He tries to supply the trumpets
          and the flags; the citizens and the apprentices. He
          nourishes the 
            inadeuate (inadequate) emotion with a dip into ,
          with a dip into . He labours to supply the sunk
          part of the play. He is 
            perpetaully (perpetually) rebuffed. He is apt
          to become not a reader but a student; a 
            crafeul (careful) collector of
          old scattered bones. At some point however in Elizabethan
          drama the readerr is born. When the dramatist 
            beceomes (becomes) consi
          of the play as a work of art; when he is able to unite the
          play by something in himself--his personality, his
          conception-- it is then that, he brings the reader into 
            beig (being)

          We can be sure then that the reader has been
          in existence for round about four hundred years. But his
          life history is an obscure one. At some point his ear must
          have lost 
            i s (its) 
            acutness (acuteness); then his 
            eyees (eyes) became dulled.
          Later he became more conscious of the suggestions and echoes
          in words. He imported much into the 
            w itten (written) word that was
          unintended xxxxxxx by the writer. A word given in its
          Elizabethan spelling brings in suggestions that give it
          almost another meaning. The words suggest other manners,
          other clothes. They accent the contrast between one society
          and another. And as the habit of reading becomes universal,
          many 
            varities (varieties) of reader are created. There are the
