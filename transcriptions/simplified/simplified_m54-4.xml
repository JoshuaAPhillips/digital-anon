           has emerged 
            suffievcntly (sufficiently) from the forests and the
          floods to let us see a rough outline of a human shape.
          He has a dog and a garden. He has books; and he digs in
          the earth. His name is of no great moment. It may be
          Harrison; or it may be . There is very little to dis 
            dis (distinguish)
          
            tingusih (distinguish) one from the other. He has no 
            exr ssion (expression) on his 
            fae (face)
          He conveys to us chiefly what his eye sees, what his body
          feels. He sees 
            ngland (England) very clearly. He sees
          its 
            emptines (emptiness); ; he conveys the scarcity of people; the
          
            predominace (predominance) of individuals. The  is the dominant
          
            fogure (figure). He can count her 
            posses ons (possessions)-- a few ships; a few
          great 
            hous s (houses). He watches her 
            progeresses (progresses). She is 
            parliemtn (parliament),
          press, society, law and order. But the man who sees this
          the individual, is still cumbered and stiff. Writing is
          still an art that requires great ceremony. What you make
          with the pen is separate from what you say with the tongue.
          Only a few years back words were written 
            elbaorately (elaborately) in
          lustrous ink upon valuable parchment; and the leaves,
          bound together, were chained to the lectern and read,
          by a few, in great physical discomfort,
          on hard 
            neches (benches) in the cold. Even now, when words are printed,
          the great public is not the reader, or the paymaster.
          Written words must please a single man in the first place,
          must find its way into some noble room, where the nobles
          and the gentry, have 
            lisure (leisure) after hunting, after
          seeing their estates, and 
            contrlling (controlling) their servants,
          to to pick up a book and read its history or sing its song.
          For Words must tell stories; or they must sound to
          the ear. For the nobles had their music; they played tunes

          It is the printing press 
            th t (that) disturbs this company.
          It is the printing press that makes the writer a 
            nany (many) headed
          many limbed. a mongrel with so many different 
            pearants (parents)
          that it requires a 
            hole (whole) army of learned men, and a perpetual
          provision of fine tasters to keep any order or distinction
          
            etween (between) the different members. The presses of , 
          , sucking in copy, and casting out legible books
          that 
            nany one (any one) could read was not a nice 
            fedder ([feeder?]). Anything
          that could be written could be printed. What Any morality,
          any record, whatever men wished 
            recored (recorded), it would deliver
          as a book. Unlike the 
            pa nter (painter) or the musician the writer
          after the birth of the printing press is exposed to
          innumerable 
            inappropirate (inappropriate) and 
            irelveant (irrelevant) 
            s licitaions (solcitations).
          Why not write the 
            hist (history) of your parish? Or the life of a
          Roman emperor? Why not take part in the 
            governement (government) of your
          country? Why not advise the soul of its 
            erils (perils)? Why not become
          
            pampheleteer (pamphleteer) 
            histroain (historian) moralist, or playwright? The Press is
          read to accept anything. And as the 
            oublic (public) becomes less
          
            serivile (servile), less martial less concerned to keep out the cold
          and fight the enemy, as glass is fitted into windows
          and pillows replace logs, the public adds its own invitation
          to the writer. It is an inquisitive 
            acti e (active) minded public;
          it soon dissipates and takes hold of . It makes him
          into an innumerable 
            comany (company) of familiar 
            sprits (spirits), one
          
            pr aching (preaching) another delighting, 
            anotherinstructing (another instructing). Only a few
          still persist into making words into works of art.
