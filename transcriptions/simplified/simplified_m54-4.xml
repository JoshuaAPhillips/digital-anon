           has emerged 
            sufficiently (suffievcntly) from the forests and the<br/>
          floods to let us see a rough outline of a human shape.<br/>
          He has a dog and a garden. He has books; and he digs in<br/>
          the earth. His name is of no great moment. It may be<br/>
          Harrison; or it may be . There is very little to dis 
            distinguish (dis)<br/>
          
            distinguish (tingusih) one from the other. He has no 
            expression (exr ssion) on his 
            face (fae)<br/>
          He conveys to us chiefly what his eye sees, what his body<br/>
          feels. He sees 
            England (ngland) very clearly. He sees<br/>
          its 
            emptiness (emptines); ; he conveys the scarcity of people; the<br/>
          
            predominance (predominace) of individuals. The  is the dominant<br/>
          
            figure (fogure). He can count her 
            possessions (posses ons)-- a few ships; a few<br/>
          great 
            houses (hous s). He watches her 
            progresses (progeresses). She is 
            parliament (parliemtn),<br/>
          press, society, law and order. But the man who sees this<br/>
          the individual, is still cumbered and stiff. Writing is<br/>
          still an art that requires great ceremony. What you make<br/>
          with the pen is separate from what you say with the tongue.<br/>
          Only a few years back words were written 
            elaborately (elbaorately) in<br/>
          lustrous ink upon valuable parchment; and the leaves,<br/>
          bound together, were chained to the lectern and read,<br/>
          by a few, in great physical discomfort,<br/>
          on hard 
            benches (neches) in the cold. Even now, when words are printed,<br/>
          the great public is not the reader, or the paymaster.<br/>
          Written words must please a single man in the first place,<br/>
          must find its way into some noble room, where the nobles<br/>
          and the gentry, have 
            leisure (lisure) after hunting, after<br/>
          seeing their estates, and 
            controlling (contrlling) their servants,<br/>
          to to pick up a book and read its history or sing its song.<br/>
          For Words must tell stories; or they must sound to<br/>
          the ear. For the nobles had their music; they played tunes

          It is the printing press

          It is the printing press that makes the writer a

          many limbed. a mongrel with so many different 
            parents (pearants)<br/>

          , sucking in copy, and casting out legible books<br/>

            any one (nany one) could read was not a nice

          any record, whatever men wished

          Why not write the

          Roman emperor? Why not take part in the 
            government (governement) of your<br/>
          country? Why not advise the soul of its 
            perils (erils)? Why not become<br/>
          
            pamphleteer (pampheleteer) 
            historian (histroain) moralist, or playwright? The Press is<br/>
          read to accept anything. And as the 
            public (oublic) becomes less<br/>
          
            servile (serivile), less martial less concerned to keep out the cold<br/>
          and fight the enemy, as glass is fitted into windows<br/>
          and pillows replace logs, the public adds its own invitation<br/>
          to the writer. It is an inquisitive
