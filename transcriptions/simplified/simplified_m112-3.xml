          so long as the play was dominant. The audience at the play
          house had to draw in txxxx the play with their eyes and
          ears. Without a book of the words they could not deepen and
          revise the impression left by the play, or ask those
          questions that are debated now in every newspaper. The lack
          of general reading accounts for the long pause between
           death and the 
            k8th (18th) century when the plays of
          
            Shakespere (Shakespeare) hung suspended, unrealised-- even in 17
           could say that 
            Shakespera (Shakespeare) still lacked
          half his 
            proer (proper) fame. The lack of a reading public
          accounts too for the scarcity of criticism and for the
          general nature of what criticism there is. Both  and
           are writing for the small critical public, and thus
          deal with 
            ggneral (general) questions, and not with 
            partciualr (particular) books
          and

          As the habit of reading becomes universal, readers split off
          into different classes. There is the

          attaches himself to certain aspects of the 
            rpinted (printed) word.
