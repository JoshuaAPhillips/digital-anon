          so long as the play was dominant. The audience at the play<br/>
          house had to draw in txxxx the play with their eyes and<br/>
          ears. Without a book of the words they could not deepen and<br/>
          revise the impression left by the play, or ask those<br/>
          questions that are debated now in every newspaper. The lack<br/>
          of general reading accounts for the long pause between<br/>
           death and the 
            18th (k8th) century when the plays of<br/>
          
            Shakespeare (Shakespere) hung suspended, unrealised-- even in 17<br/>
           could say that 
            Shakespeare (Shakespera) still lacked<br/>
          half his 
            proper (proer) fame. The lack of a reading public<br/>
          accounts too for the scarcity of criticism and for the<br/>
          general nature of what criticism there is. Both  and<br/>
           are writing for the small critical public, and thus<br/>
          deal with 
            general (ggneral) questions, and not with 
            particular (partciualr) books<br/>
          and 
            persons (perons).

          As the habit of reading becomes universal, readers split off<br/>
          into different classes. There is the

            printed (rpinted) word.<br/>

          yet never read a word. Finally
