          "For many centuries after Britain became an island" the 
          orian says " "the untamed forest was king." Its 
            mosit (moist) and
          
            mssy (mossy) floor was hidden from heavens eye by a close drawn
          curtain of innumerable treetops. " On the matted bough
          innumerable birds 
            snag (sang); but their song was only heard by a
          few skin clad hunters in the 
            claetings (clearings). Did the desire
          to sing come to one of those <sup>barbarians</sup> savages because he 
            geard (heard) the
          birds sing, and so rested his axe against the tree for a
          moment? Anyhow, the tree was felled; some sort of hut
          was made from its branches; and the clearing became larger;
          the birds 
            f   er (fewer); and the human voice sang instead. The first
          songs are out of door songs; spring songs; summer songs;
          winter songs.

          The heart of this vast proliferation of printed
          pages is the song. The song has the same power over the
          reader in the 20th century as over the hearer in the
          11th. To enjoy singing, to enjoy 
            h aring (hearing) the song,
          must be the deepest rooted and tough of human instincts.
          It is an instinct of self-preservation, for only when we
          put two and two together to we overcome dissolution. Two
          lines, two words, two 
            bri cks (bricks) make way against oblivion.
          <s>Making whatever it is gives us life;</s> and the passion
          with which we seek for these creations, and attempt to
          make them, is of a piece with the instinct that
          sets us preserving our bodies from wet, or cold.
          But with the printing press came into existence
          forces that cover over the original song--books
          themselves and the readers of books. Could we at this
          this moment X ray the singers mind we shound <sup>f</sup>ind
          a nimbus surrounding the song; a 
            st eam (stream) of
