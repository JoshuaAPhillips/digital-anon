          "For many centuries after Britain became an island" the <br/>
          orian says " "the untamed forest was king." Its 
            moist (mosit) and<br/>
          
            mossy (mssy) floor was hidden from heavens eye by a close drawn<br/>
          curtain of innumerable treetops. " On the matted bough<br/>
          innumerable birds 
            sang (snag); but their song was only heard by a<br/>
          few skin clad hunters in the 
            clearings (claetings). Did the desire<br/>
          to sing come to one of those <sup>barbarians</sup> savages because he 
            heard (geard) the<br/>
          birds sing, and so rested his axe against the tree for a<br/>
          moment? Anyhow, the tree was felled; some sort of hut<br/>
          was made from its branches; and the clearing became larger;<br/>
          the birds 
            fewer (f   er); and the human voice sang instead. The first<br/>
          songs are out of door songs; spring songs; summer songs;<br/>
          winter songs.

          The heart of this vast proliferation of printed<br/>
          pages is the song. The song has the same power over the<br/>
          reader in the 20th century as over the hearer in the<br/>
          11th. To enjoy singing, to enjoy 
            hearing (h aring) the song,<br/>
          must be the deepest rooted and tough of human instincts.<br/>
          It is an instinct of self-preservation, for only when we<br/>
          put two and two together to we overcome dissolution. Two<br/>
          lines, two words, two 
            bricks (bri cks) make way against oblivion.<br/>
          <s>Making whatever it is gives us life;</s> and the passion<br/>
          with which we seek for these creations, and attempt to<br/>
          make them, is of a piece with the instinct that<br/>
          sets us preserving our bodies from wet, or cold.<br/>
          But with the printing press came into existence<br/>
          forces that cover over the original song--books<br/>
          themselves and the readers of books. Could we at this<br/>
          this moment X ray the singers mind we shound <sup>f</sup>ind<br/>
          a nimbus surrounding the song; a 
            stream (st eam) of<br/>

          class; <sup>material; economic</sup> of
