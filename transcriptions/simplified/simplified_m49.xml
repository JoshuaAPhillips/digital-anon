          <sup>[</sup>The heart of this vast
            proliferation (prolieferation) of printed pages<br/>
          remains the song. The song has the same power over the reader<br/>
          in the 20th 
            century (cen ury) as over the hearer in the 11th. To enjoy<br/>
          singing, to enjoy hearing the sing, must be the most<br/>
          deep rooted, the toughest of human instincts comparable<br/>
          for persistency with the instinct of self preservation<br/>
          It is indeed the instinct of self preservation.<br/>
          Only  when we put two and two together--two pencil strokes,<br/>
          two written words, two bricks do we overcome
            dissolution (doissolution)<br/>
          and set up some stake against oblivion. The passion with<br/>
          which we seek out these
            creations (creation) and attempt endlessly,<br/>
          perpetually, to make them is of a piece with the instinct<br/>
          that sets us preserving
            our (out) bodies, with clothes, food,<br/>
          roofs, from destruction.<sup>]</sup>

          of these searchers <s>can find

          <s>They</s> polish the shell only. They <s>linger</s><sup>remain</sup> upon the habits and<br/>
          the furniture, the house itself, It is as if we were told<br/>
          that the novelist  had a tweed suit,<br/>
          six hats, some bowlers some top hats; and <s>used to</s><br/>
          take a walking stick in his hand and when he walked;<br/>
          and had his meat cooked on a coal fire, by a woman whose<br/>

          soldiers and

          stone houses,

          remains, stiff and ornate, 
            fantastic (fanatstic) and uncushioned.
