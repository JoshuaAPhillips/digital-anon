          <sup>[</sup>The heart of this vast
            prolieferation (proliferation) of printed pages
          remains the song. The song has the same power over the reader
          in the 20th 
            cen ury (century) as over the hearer in the 11th. To enjoy
          singing, to enjoy hearing the sing, must be the most
          deep rooted, the toughest of human instincts comparable
          for persistency with the instinct of self preservation
          It is indeed the instinct of self preservation.
          Only  when we put two and two together--two pencil strokes,
          two written words, two bricks do we overcome
            doissolution (dissolution)
          and set up some stake against oblivion. The passion with
          which we seek out these
            creation (creations) and attempt endlessly,
          perpetually, to make them is of a piece with the instinct
          that sets us preserving
            out (our) bodies, with clothes, food,
          roofs, from destruction.<sup>]</sup>
