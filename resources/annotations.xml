        <persName>Acton, Sir Francis</persName>
        <note>Sir Francis Acton is an antagonist in one of the two intertwined subplots of <rs xml:id="psh-they">Thomas Heywood</rs>'s domestic tragedy <rs xml:id="lit-woma">A Woman Killed with Kindness</rs>. He is the brother of <rs xml:id="psn-franb">Anne Frankford</rs> (persistently referred to by Woolf as Frankland). He and Sir Charles Mountford brawl over the result of a hawking competition, and in the brawl Mountford kills Acton's two huntsmen. Mountford is released from prison but left impoverished by the fees: at the time Heywood was writing, English gaols charged their inmates for food, upkeep, and any privileges that an inmate could afford, and becomes significantly indebted and returns to prison as a debtor. Seeking further revenge against Mountford, Acton decides to seduce Mountford's sister, Susan. Acton wishes to use their affair to disgrace Mountford but falls in love with Susan. Hoping to win Susan's affection, Acton pays off Mountford's debts and drops charges for the murder of his huntsmen. In a gesture of thanks, Mountford offers his sister to Acton, whether to marry or 'To seize her as a rape or lustful prey [...] To murder her that never meant thee harm' (14.127-9). Susan reluctantly agrees to marry Acton when he professes his genuine love for her. See <rs xml:id="lit-woma">A Woman Killed With Kindness for more details</rs>.</note>

        <note>Henricus Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim was a 15th and 16th century German polymath who claimed to have doctoral degrees in theology, medicine, and law. He wore many hats over his life, teaching at the universities of Dôle and Padua, practiced law in Metz and medicine in Geneva, Fribourg and Antwerp, acted as court astrologer to Louise de Savoi in Lyon and court historiographer to Margaret of Austria (cf. Hoorens and Renders, pp. 3-4). Agrippa was best known, however, as the author of works of skeptical and occultist philosophy. However, it should be noted that the Agrippa Woolf names in these drafts is somewhat of an outlier: an early modern interloper among lists of classical orators and writers. Of the many ancient Romans named Agrippa, Woolf may have had in mind Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (c. 63–12 BCE), statesman and soldier discussed by Horace, <rs xml:id="psn-suet">Suetonius</rs>, and Livy, among others.</note>

        <persName>Archbishop of Canterbury</persName>
        <note>The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the head of the Anglican church worldwide. Woolf makes several references to different Archbishops of Canterbury throughout the drafts of 'Anon.' Woolf mentions at least two. The earliest she mentions in found in conjuction with Caxton and the English mythscape of <rs xml:id="lit-mort">Le Mort D'Arthur</rs>: symbols of Arthurian romance and mythical kingship are juxtaposed with the temporal and mundane trappings of power that resides in London and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop of Canterbury in situ when Caxton printed <rs xml:id="lit-mort">Le Mort D'Arthur</rs> was Thomas Bourgchier (c. 1411-1486), who served at the same time as Chancellor of England, and though he sided with <rs xml:id="lit-hen6">Henry VI</rs> in the War of the Roses, he found favour with Henry's Lancastrian successor <rs xml:id="psn-edw4">Edward IV</rs> (Clark n.p.). 
          
        Another Archbishop is to be found in Woolf's discussions of <rs xml:id="psn-hlat">Hugh Latimer</rs>'s sermons. In his Second Sermon preached before <rs xml:id="psn-edw6">King Edward</rs>, Latimer talks of 'troubl[ing] my Lord of Canterbury and being at his house, now and then I walke in the Garden looking in my booke', befire being interrupted by 'one at the gate would speake with you' (Latimer 40). Woolf uses this anecdote in her discussion of Latimer. Though Latimer does not name the Archbishop in question, it is likely to be his friend and co-reformer, Thomas Cranmer. Cranmer served <rs xml:id="psn-hen8">Henry VIII</rs> for much of his reign, first providing theological arguments in support of Henry's divorce from Katherine of Aragon. Cranmer was elevated to Archbishop of Canterbury in 1533 and did much to establish the Church of England's independence from <rs xml:id="pla-rome">Rome</rs>. Cranmer was burnt at the stake in 1556 (MacCulloch, n.p.). 
      
        Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time Woolf wrote the 'Anon' drafts was Cosmo Gordon Lang, at whom she had already taken aim in <hi rend="italic">TG</hi>. Though only referred to pseudonymously as 'An Archbishop,' Lang is one of the three photographed figures who punctuate Woolf's 1938 essay (247) and the photograph is used metonymically to refer to the Church's historical and contemporary exclusion of women.</note>

        <note>Francis Beaumont was an English playwright, best known for his plays written with John Fletcher, even if only nine plays in the 1647 folio <hi rend="italic">Comedies and Tragedies written by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, Gentlemen</hi> can be definitively attributed to the pair (cf. Finkelpearl, n.p.). As a figure who almost always worked in collaboration with others, his body of work has waxed and waned over the centuries. Beaumont frequented the <rs xml:id="pla-merm">Mermaid Tavern</rs>, where he reputedly met <rs xml:id="psn-bjon">Ben Jonson</rs> (cf. O'Callaghan n.p.). The Woolfs had two editions of works by (or at least attributed to) Beaumont and Fletcher in their library: an 1840 edition which had belonged to Leslie Stephen, with his annotations and drawings, and a two-volume set published as part of the Mermaid series 'The Best Plays of the Old Dramatists' and edited by John St. Loe Strachey, cousin to Lytton Strachey. VW took notes on <hi rend="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</hi> (1619, Beaumont and Fletcher) and <hi rend="italic">The Two Noble Kinsmen</hi> (1613-4?), which was attributed previously to Beaumont and Fletcher but is now attributed to <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> and Fletcher (Cf.

        <note>Thomas Bilney, known by the diminuitive nickname Little Bilney, was a priest, evangelical reformist preacher and, ultimately, martyr who was educated in Cambridge and preached across <rs xml:id="pla-norf">Norfolk</rs> and East Anglia. Having read Erasmus's Latin translation of the New Testament in 1516, Bilney became an enthusiastic reformer in Cambridge, and converted a number of his fellow scholars including <rs xml:id="psn-hlat">Hugh Latimer</rs>. By 1525, Bilney was touring East Anglia, preaching against pilgrimages and veneration of saints' remains and icons. In November 1527, he was put on trial for heresy for the first time and escaped death by renouncing his previous teachings, and was instead imprisoned for two years. In 1531, he began to preach again in the open, and was swiftly put on trial and burnt at the stake as a relapsed heretic (cf. Carter n.p.).</note>

Burton was a life-long student of Christ Church College, Oxford, where he studied theology and practiced an eclectic autodidacticism. Though he held positions other than that of the 'tumbler over of other mens books' (M112, Set 3 of 3 [The Reader: so long as the play was dominant.] fol. 1r) the <hi rend="italic">Anatomy</hi> was his life's work, and little else by him survives beyond a Latin university comedy titled <hi rend="italic">Philophaster</hi> (1606-15).</note>

Both were conservative politicians and noted orators: Cato the Elder wrote <hi rend="italic">De agri cultura</hi>, the oldest extant work of Latin prose, while Cato the Younger campaigned against Julius Caesar in the civil war that birthed the Roman Empire. Woolf references Joseph Addison's <hi rend="italic">Cato, a Tragedy</hi> (1712) in her <hi rend="italic">CR1</hi> essay titled 'Addison' and <hi rend="italic">O</hi>. Addison's play dramatises the final days of Caesar's civil war and of Cato the Younger's life.

        <note>Lady Anne Clifford, countess of Pembroke, Dorset, and Montgomery was a woman of letters and a noblewoman associated with the court of <rs xml:id="psn-kjam">James I</rs>. Her surviving diaries, kept between January 1616 and December 1617, speak to her love of literature and vigorous autodidacticism: she writes of reading (or listening to) the Bible, contemporary literature including the <rs xml:id="lit-essa">Essays</rs> of <rs xml:id="psn-mmon">Michel de Montaigne</rs> and <rs xml:id="psn-espe">Edmund Spenser</rs>'s long poem <rs xml:id="lit-faer">The Faerie Queene</rs>, Turkish history, and the sermons of John Donne, whom she met at least once, on the 20th July 1617 (Clifford 74). For his part, Donne said of Clifford that 'she knew well how to discourse of all things, from predestination to slea-silk' (Spence n.p.). The extant portions of Clifford's diaries were written in the shadow of legal disputes sparked by her father George Clifford, third earl of Cumberland's unlawful decision to settle his estate not upon Clifford but upon his brother, Francis Clifford and Clifford's decision to challenge the will. This was a challenge that ended only with Francis Clifford's death without male heirs, upon which the lot reverted to Anne Clifford (cf. Sackville-West in Clifford, xxviii-xxx). Anne Clifford spent much of the period that the diaries cover at <rs xml:id="pla-knol">Knole</rs>, the house in which Vita Sackville-West was born and Orlando's great house in <hi rend="italic">O</hi>. 
          
        The Woolfs had a copy of Sackville-West's 1924 edition of Clifford's diaries in their library: Woolf made three sets of notes on it, in preparation for <hi rend="italic">CRI</hi> and again in preparing to write the 'Anon' drafts (cf. Silver <hi rend="italic">RN</hi> XIX, XXXVII, see also RN2. [Holograph reading notes] Notes for reading at random., fol. 8r). At some point, LW annotated this volume. VW writes to VSW twice about Anne Clifford, first on Boxing Day 1940 (<hi rend="italic">L</hi>6 454-5, no. 3672) and the second time on 4 February 1941 (<hi rend="italic">L</hi>6 469-70, no. 3689), both times asking for biographies and material on her life: as VW notes in the latter of the two letters, their Mecklenburgh Square residence had been bombed and 'all my books are to bits.'</note>

In spite of growing success as a pamphleteer, he spent 1613–20 in debtors' prison, and sought to reestablish himself as a playwright following his release (cf. Twyning n.p.). The Woolfs had two editions of Dekker in their library, one part of the Mermaid series 'The Best Plays of the Old Dramatists' and the other a 1924 Bodley Head reprint of his 1603 pamphlet <hi rend="italic">The VVonderful Yeare</hi>, a prose account of the death of Elizabeth I and of the plague epidemic of that year. VW took notes on two of his plays, <hi rend="italic">Old Fortunatus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Witch of Edmonton</hi> in preparation for <hi rend="italic">CRI</hi>, noting of the latter that it was 'odd, because its apparently about real people, of the lower classes, &amp; at the present time–—all unlikely in E<hi rend="superscript">than</hi> drama.' She later made notes on <hi rend="italic">The VVonderful Yeare</hi> in preparation for <hi rend="italic">CRII</hi> (cf. Silver XIX, XXXII).</note>

        It is unclear why Woolf mentions Feilding, the Earl of Denbigh in this distinctly witchy context (cf. M1-8, 1 of 10. [The great Elizabethan house, Penshurst...], fol. 4r). However, in 1594, a Gwen verch Ellis was put on trial, and possibly executed, for witchcraft in Denbigh, Wales (Parkin).

        <note>Edward Tudor was the son of Jane Seymour and, as his only male heir, the short-lived successor to <rs xml:id="psn-hen8">Henry VIII</rs> as king of England and Ireland. Though his reign was curtailed by what was most likely a combination of tuberculosis and measles or smallpox, he was nonetheless influential. He was crowned with great pomp on 19 February 1547: the <rs xml:id="psn-arch">Archbishop of Canterbury</rs>, Thomas Cramner, proclaimed him 'God's Viceregent, and Christ's Vicar,' and in this capacity oversaw much of the reformatory work Cramner had begun under the previous monarch –– perhaps most significantly for the development of English as a literary language, this work included the 1549 introduction of the vernacular <hi rend="italics">Book of Common Prayer</hi> (Hoak n.p.). 
          
        In M1-8, 2 of 10. Anon.

Anon. Typescript fragment..., fol. 18r, she adds further nuance, writing that he paradoxically gave minstrels a new 'lease of life' insofar as he 'was rescuing [English] from the back door' at which Anon had sung. It is not a stretch to see Cramner's vernacular prayerbook as part of this same recovery.</note>

        <note>Little is known about Ingram Frizer's life, save that he killed <rs xml:id="psn-cmar">Christopher Marlowe</rs> in what is popularly believed to have been a tavern brawl on 30 May 1593 in <rs xml:id="pla-dept">Deptford</rs>, London, although more recently this popular conception has been called into question (cf. Nicholl, n.p.). Though it may have taken place in private rather than a tavern, the specific details of Frizer's fight with Marlowe are less doubtful. In M108 [The Reader: There is a jolt at the points.], fol. 5v, Woolf paraphrases G.B. Harrison's account of Marlowe's death, itself a paraphrase of contemporary court records: 'malicious words passed between Marlowe and Frizer about the payment of the reckoning, until Marlowe [...] sprang on Frizer [...] and taking Frizer's dagger from his back wounded him twice in the head. Frizer being then put in fear of his life strove to get his dagger back, and in the struggle gave Marlowe a mortal wound over the right eye of which he instantly died' (G.B. Harrison, 258). Woolf read and took notes on G.B. Harrison's <hi rend="italic">An Elizabethan Journal</hi> (1928) in 1940, in preparation for the 'Anon' drafts (cf. Silver XXXVII), and had a copy of his 1923 <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare’s Fellows: Being a Brief Chronicle of the Shakespearean Age</hi> in her library (cf. King and Miletic-Vejzovic n.p.).</note>

        <note>Philip Henslowe was a theatre financier and patron, whose diary provides an invaluable window into the business of the Jacobean stage. Henslowe financed and took an active interest in the construction of the <rs xml:id="pla-rose">Rose</rs> playhouse in <rs xml:id="pla-sout">Southwark</rs>, and its resident theatre company, Lord Strange's Men, later the Lord Admiral's Men. In 1600, he began work on another playhouse, the <rs xml:id="pla-fort">Fortune</rs>, as a joint venture with the actor Edward Alleyn. Henslowe was a success at the court of <rs xml:id="psn-kjam">King James</rs>, being appointed as gentleman sewer of the chamber in 1603 and jointly purchasing the mastership of the royal game with Alleyn, which would enable them to license bear baiting, in 1604 –– they held baiting at the Rose fortnightly (cf. Cerasano n.p.) Henslowe's diary is somewhat of a composite volume: it contains accounts kept by a John Henslowe regarding the 'felling and disposal of timber and other matters in Ashdown forest' from 1576-1581, and thereafter contains a mixture of what Greg describes as 'accounts and memoranda relating both to private affairs, dramatic and other' from 1592 to 1609. It contains accounts of family business, matters relating to the Rose and the performances therein, details of monies lent and received, astrological formulae, medical recipes and charms, and details of a joint starch-making venture he undertook with Alleyn. The small folio volume lay undiscovered in the archives of Dulwich College, a boys' school in London, until 1780 where they remain today (Greg in Henslowe i.xii-xxiii). Woolf read the two-volume edition of Henslowe's diary edited by <rs xml:id="psn-greg">W. W. Greg</rs> in preparation for her work on the 'Anon' drafts, gleaning much of her information on the material conditions of the early stage from Greg's exhaustive commentary on the diary (Cf.

By 1594, he was part of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> and Richard Burbage's theatre company. He is known to have played the roles of Peter, the Nurse's servant in <rs xml:id="lit-rome">Romeo and Juliet</rs> and Dogberry in <hi rend="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</hi>, and it is conjectured that he played Bottom and Falstaff. By 1599 he had sold his share of the lease of the <rs xml:id="pla-glob">Globe</rs> and left the company. Kemp returned to clowning and his next public appearance was a highly unlikely one: in 1600, he performed a morris dance from <rs xml:id="pla-lond">London</rs> to <rs xml:id="pla-norw">Norwich</rs>, a journey of roughly 130 miles. He advertised this in a pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Kemp's Nine Daies Wonder</hi>. The precise date of his death is unknown, though it is likely that he died in 1603, a particularly bad plague year (Eccles III 293-5).</note>

        <note>Thomas Kyd was an English playwright, best-known for <rs xml:id="lit-span">The Spanish Tragedy</rs>, though it was not attributed to him until 1773, over 175 years after his death: the play was considered anonymous until that point (cf. Mulryne n.p.). Details of Kyd's life are scant until he was arrested on charges of libel on 11th May 1593: officers searched Kyd's lodgings and did not find libellous material; rather, they found material deeped heretical. Kyd was almost certainly tortured by 'strappado' and wrote letters upon his release claiming that the heretical material belonged to <rs xml:id="psn-cmar">Christopher Marlowe</rs>, with whom he was sharing lodgings. Kyd wrote these letters after Marlowe's death on 30th May 1593, and died himself shortly afterwards (Calvo and Tronch in Kyd 6-9).</note>

        <note>John Marston was a poet, playwright and priest perhaps best known for his long-running literary feud with <rs xml:id="psn-bjon">Ben Jonson</rs>. It is likely that Marston satirically portrayed Jonson in <hi rend="italic">Histriomastix</hi>, and that Marston was the target of several of Jonson's satirical forays. This, however, did not stop Marston from providing a prefatory poem to Jonson's <hi rend="italic">Sejanus</hi> (1605) or dedicating his own play, <hi rend="italic">The Malcontent</hi> (1603-4) to him. The latter play, a dark comedy, was one of Marston's most successful plays. By 1609, Marston had become ordained as a priest, and thereafter he slowly fades from the historical record (Knowles n.p.). The Woolfs' library contains an 1856 three-volume edition of Marston's plays, signed and annotated by Leslie Stephen. Woolf rebound (CHECK) volumes, but if she read any of the plays, no notes are extant.</note>

        <note>Thomas Middleton is credited as the only English renaissance playwright other than <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> to 'created plays still considered masterpieces in four major dramatic genres: comedy, history, tragedy, and tragicomedy' (Taylor in Middleton i.25): he also wrote prose satire, masques and pageants. He collaborated with Shakespeare, writing part of <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>, and sold Shakespeare's company, The King's Men, the text of <rs xml:id="lit-reve">The Revenger's Tragedy</rs> to perform, thereby beginning a commercial and artistic partnership that would endure past Shapespeare's death in 1616. Middleton was 'apparently the only playwright trusted by the King's Men to update Shakespeare's plays after his death' (Taylor n.p.). Middleton's final play, <hi rend="italic">A Game at Chess</hi> was his greatest commercial success but also proved his downfall. A theological and political satire that gives the Spanish Match, an unsuccessful attempt by <rs xml:id="psn-jam">King James I</rs> to ally Protestant England and Catholic Spain through marriage, allegorical form as a chess game. The play sees England and Spain locked in a ritualised, carefully choreographed intrigue – the play's characters are chess pieces moving across a board, struggling for advantage and to avoid '[t]he bag [which], like hell-mouth, opens | To take her due' (V.iii ll.179-80). The play was performed for an unprecedented nine days, from 5-14th August 1624, before it was closed down. The Privy Council ordered a manhunt for Middleton, after which he was probably imprisoned: thereafter he stopped writing for the stage (Taylor n.p.). Unlike many of his contemporaries, VW did not make reading notes on Middleton (or at least none are extant), and none of his works are catalogued in their library.</note>

        <note>Bartholomew Oliver’s Afghan Hound named Sohrab. The <hi>locus classicus</hi> for the name Sohrab is Matthew Arnold’s 1853 quasi-Miltonic epic poem ‘Sohrab and Rustum.’ Woolf knew this poem: her library contain’s Arnold’s 1859 Poems, which prints ‘Sohrab and Rustum,’ while she reports in a diary entry of 9th May 1897 that Leslie Stephen recited the poem ‘after dinner’ (PA 83). Arnold’s poem relates how Rustum, an Iranian warrior, killed Sohrab, a warrior in the Tatar host and the son Rustum did not know he had, in single combat (Arnold 302-331). The name Sohrab is a double intertext: within Woolf’s own corpus it recalls Old Rustum in Orlando (cf. O 131), the gypsy who disabuses the newly female Orlando of her pride in what she had previously considered her illustrious heritage (O 136). As a further doggy aside, Orlando has a 'seluchi' (or saluki) in Turkey (O 129)—a type of sighthound related to the Afghan hound.</note>

It is likely that Woolf found this description in the 1862 edition, which contains a brief, unattributed biography of Spenser with this line. Look at essay on Faerie Qveene, etc.</note>

        <note>Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, was a poet and a soldier who had the dubious honour of being the last person executed on the orders of Henry VIII. While putting down an uprising in Lincolnshire and East Anglia, a folk ballad emerged that questioned Howard's loyalties. He fell from grace, and though Henry VIII sent him to lead troops in northern France in October 1543, his failure in this campaign led to his downfall. He was put on trial for treason on New Year's Day of 1547 and by the 19th of that month he was dead (cf. Brigden n.p.).</note>

        <note>A tragicomedy in blank verse by playwright John Fletcher.

Fletcher's plot is simple, and to some extent given away by the title: Memnon, a victorious general and the titular mad lover of the play, is driven 'starke mad' (Fletcher I, ii, ll. 110) over love of Calis, the king's sister.</note>

        <note>An extravagantly gory satire that recapitulates a great many tropes and figurations common to the revenge tragedy genre. Written for the King's Men in 1606 (Jackson in Middleton i.544), published anonymously in 1607-8 and mistakenly ascribed to <rs xml:id="psn-ctou">Cyril Tourneur</rs> but now credited to  <rs xml:id="psn-tmid">Thomas Middleton</rs> (i.546). The play opens with Vindice holding the skull of Gloriana, his 'poisoned love' (I.i, l. 14) and swearing to 'give Revenge her due' (I.i l. 43) by exacting vengeance on her murderer, the Duke. Also plotting revenge and jostling for position at court are Duke's sons, Lussurio and the illegitimate Spurio; his wife the Duchess and his stepsons Ambitioso, Supervacuo and Junior join the fun. Vindice has his revenge when he disguises himself as Piato, a 'pander' or pimp, and is hired by the Duke to 'greet him with a lady | In some fit place veiled from the eyes o'th' court' (III.iv ll.11-12). The lady in question is the skull of Gloriana, dressed in a wig and dress, its mouth smeared with poison. The Duke kisses Gloriana's skull and dies a painful death as the poison eats at his teeth and tongue. Some time later Vindice attempts to frame the Duke's sons and stepsons at a masque held at the new Duke Lussurio's court, which sees Lussurio murdered: in a frenzy the other sons kill one another. In the play's very final moments, Vindice is found to have engineered everything, but he accepts his death, asking 'are we not revenged? Is there one enemy left alive among those' (V.iii ll. 107-8). In M1-8, 5 of 10. The Reader, Woolf highlights an 'extraordinary intensification' that 'comes fitfully' to the Jacobean stage: <hi rend="italic">The Revenger's Tragedy</hi> is nothing if not intense in the single-mindedness of its satire and, of course, its sheer and unstinting violence.</note>

        <note>Jacobean drama written in the late 16th century by <rs xml:id="psn-kyd">Thomas Kyd</rs>, though only attributed to him after his death and considered anonymous until 1773. The play was most likely composed after the Battle of Terceira on the 26th July 1582 (Calvo and Tronch in Kyd 13) and certainly before the 23rd February 1592 performance by the Lord Strangers' Men that <rs xml:id="psn-phen">Philip Henslowe</rs> records in his diary, though he calls it 'spanes comodye donne oracoe' [Spanish Comedy of Don Horatio] (Henslowe i.13). Though no record of its first performance survives, it was nonetheless 'one of the first and longest-lasting Renaissance box-office hits' (Calvo and Tronch in Kyd 1), and Kyd's play revitalises Senecan tragedy for the English stage and originates the revenge tragedy genre. The play narrates Hieronimo's elaborate quest for revenge over the murder of his son. Hieronimo's desire for revenge drives him mad, leading him to stage a play within a play that sees him kill his son's two murderers before biting out his own tongue and killing both the Duke of Castille and himself. The play was enormously influential on the Jacobean and Elizabethan stage, providing a theatrical lexis that would be deployed by playwrights includng, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">Shakespeare</rs> (cf. <hi rend="italic">Titus Andronicus</hi>, <rs xml:id="psn-haml">Hamlet</rs>) and <rs xml:id="psn-tmid">Thomas Middleton</rs> (cf. <rs xml:id="lit-reve">The Revenger's Tragedy</rs>). The Woolfs had a standalone 1898 edition of this play in library, published as part of the Temple Dramatists series (cf. King and Miletic-Vejzovic n.p.). VW made notes on this edition in preparation for <hi rend="italic">CRI</hi> (cf. Silver XIX, XXV).</note>

        <note><hi rend="italic">A Woman Killed with Kindness</hi>, by <rs xml:id="psn-they">Thomas Heywood</rs>, was first performed in 1603 though the earliest surviving text of the play dates from 1607. The play arguably originates the genre of the domestic tragedy, and its two intertwining plots deal with lust and chastity, friendship and duty, retribution and pity: for more detailed summaries of the play's two plots, cf. <rs xml:id="psn-acto">Acton, Sir Francis</rs>, <rs xml:id="psn-frana">Frankfort (Frankland), John</rs>, <rs xml:id="psn-franb">Frankford (Frankland), Anne</rs>, and <rs xml:id="psn-wend">Wendoll</rs>. The cry of 'Oh God' that Woolf cites in M.1-8-5. The Reader, fol. 2 punctuate the play: Charles Mountford cries 'My God –– what have I done? What have I done?' (3.41) when he realises he has killed two of Acton's retainers, and Mountford's sister Susan, similarly, cries 'O God! O God!' (3.103) when her brother is imprisoned for the crime. Wendoll cries 'O God! O God! With what a violence | I am hurried to my own destruction. | There goest thou, the most perfectest man | That ever England bred [...] And shall I wrong his bed?' (6.16-20) when he is torn between his friendship with John Frankford and his infatuation with Anne Frankford. Having been told of his wife's infidelity by his servant, John Frankford says to himself in soliloquy 'O God, O God. | Shall I put up these wrongs? No. Shall I trust | The bare report of this suspicious groom | Before the double gilt, the well-hatched ore | Of their two hearts?' (8.102-5), and again cries 'O God, O God' when his servant presents him with irrefutable evidence of Anne and Wendoll's affair (13.47). He again exclaims 'O God' when discovering his wife's lute after having banished her (15.13), before directing his servant to bring the lute to Anne, while Wendoll provides the final O God, lamenting that he has 'divorced the truest turtles | That ever lived together' (16.49-50) on hearing Anne play this lute one final time.</note>

        <note>A comma is a butterfly of the species Polygonia c-album. In <hi rend="italic">A History of British Butterflies</hi> (1853 but reprinted well into the twentieth century), naturalist F.O. Morris notes that this ‘handsome and singularly shaped species’ appeared across Britain, but evidently it was rare enough (at least in the south-west London suburb of Surbiton) by the time Woolf wrote to justify being mentioned in the newspaper. With its wings closed, the butterfly looks like a fallen autumn leaf; its wings open to reveal a ‘beautiful rich fulvous orange colour.’ Cf. Morris (70-72). Francis Orpen Morris (1810-1893) was a popular British naturalist, cleric, and anti-Darwinist. In <hi rend="italic">Jacob’s Room</hi>, the young Jacob Flanders corrects one of Morris’s works, probably the four-volume <hi rend="italic">History of British Moths</hi> (1859-70), cf. <hi rend="italic">JR</hi> 34</note>

        <note>A district in the City of London between <rs xml:id="pla-stpa">St Paul's Cathedral</rs> and the Thames, centred around Blackfriars Bridge, which gave its name to two indoor, private playhouses, the latter associated with <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> and his theatre company, The King's Men. The area is named for a priory of Dominican friars (known as 'black' friars owing to the colour of their garb), who acquired land here in 1275 (Chambers ii.473). Over the next three centuries the priory waned in influence, and its estates were dissolved in 1538 by <rs xml:id="hen8">Henry VIII</rs> (ii.476). Sir William More inherited the former priory in 1560 and a theatre was established in 1576 (ii.480, 496-7). This first theatre hosted companies of boy actors and shuttered in 1587. In 1596, More sold the building's refectory to James Burbage, father of the Shakespearean actor Richard Burbage, for £600 (ii.503). On James Burbage's death, his son inherited the theatre but he and the King's Men were prohibited from using it until 1609 (Edmond n.p.), after which time its decades-long association with Shakespeare began. The theatre was closed in 1642 after the English Civil War was won by the <rs xml:id="psn-puri">Puritans</rs>, who shuttered the theatres, and the building itself was torn down in 1655 (Chambers ii.515 - CHECK). Orlando's remaining property was located here - CHECK note.</note>

        <note>Prehistoric standing stone circle on Salisbury Plain, two miles from <rs xml:id="pla-ames">Amesbury</rs>. While staying in Salisbury, August 1903, VW visited Stonehenge twice with Vanessa Bell. She wrote a sketch in her diary on each occasion. In the first sketch, she writes that 'The singular, &amp; intoxicating charm of Stonehenge to me, &amp; to most I think, is that no one in the world can tell you anything about it. There are these great blocks of stone; [...] &amp; what more? Who piled them there &amp; when, &amp; for what purpose, no one in the world [...] can tell,' and calls the circle 'a piece of wreckage washed up from Oblivion.' Given that the culture that built Stonehenge left no written records, many of VW's questions remained unanswered or unanswerable. Later on she writes that the most 'attractive, &amp; I suppose most likely' theory about the megalith's purpose is that 'some forgotten people [...] built here a Temple where they worshipped the sun,' and conjectures that a fallen stone in the middle 'may have been an altar' on which 'the Priest of that savage people slaughtered his victim [...] in honour of the Sun God' (PA 199-200). In her second, briefer, sketch describing their second visit, she calls the megalith 'a kind of altar made of earth, on which the whole world might do sacrifice' (205). These early descriptions and suppositions are of a piece with her invocation of Stonehenge as a site of ancient ritual in M.54-8.</note>
