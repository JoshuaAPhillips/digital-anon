        <persName>Acton, Sir Francis</persName>
        <note>Sir Francis Acton is an antagonist in one of the two intertwined subplots of <rs xml:id="psh-they">Thomas Heywood</rs>'s domestic tragedy <rs xml:id="lit-woma">A Woman Killed with Kindness</rs>. He is the brother of <rs xml:id="psn-franb">Anne Frankford</rs> (persistently referred to by Woolf as Frankland). He and Sir Charles Mountford brawl over the result of a hawking competition, and in the brawl Mountford kills Acton's two huntsmen. Mountford is released from prison but left impoverished by the fees: at the time Heywood was writing, English gaols charged their inmates for food, upkeep, and any privileges that an inmate could afford, and becomes significantly indebted and returns to prison as a debtor. Seeking further revenge against Mountford, Acton decides to seduce Mountford's sister, Susan. Acton wishes to use their affair to disgrace Mountford but falls in love with Susan. Hoping to win Susan's affection, Acton pays off Mountford's debts and drops charges for the murder of his huntsmen. In a gesture of thanks, Mountford offers his sister to Acton, whether to marry or 'To seize her as a rape or lustful prey [...] To murder her that never meant thee harm' (14.127-9). Susan reluctantly agrees to marry Acton when he professes his genuine love for her. See <rs xml:id="lit-woma">A Woman Killed With Kindness for more details</rs>.</note>

        <note>Henricus Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim was a 15th and 16th century German polymath who claimed to have doctoral degrees in theology, medicine, and law. He wore many hats over his life, teaching at the universities of Dôle and Padua, practiced law in Metz and medicine in Geneva, Fribourg and Antwerp, acted as court astrologer to Louise de Savoi in Lyon and court historiographer to Margaret of Austria (cf. Hoorens and Renders, pp. 3-4). Agrippa was best known, however, as the author of works of skeptical and occultist philosophy. However, it should be noted that the Agrippa Woolf names in these drafts is somewhat of an outlier: an early modern interloper among lists of classical orators and writers. Of the many ancient Romans named Agrippa, Woolf may have had in mind Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (c. 63–12 BCE), statesman and soldier discussed by Horace, <rs xml:id="psn-suet">Suetonius</rs>, and Livy, among others.</note>

        <persName>Archbishop of Canterbury</persName>
        <note>The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the head of the Anglican church worldwide. Woolf makes several references to different Archbishops of Canterbury throughout the drafts of 'Anon.' Woolf mentions at least two. The earliest she mentions in found in conjuction with Caxton and the English mythscape of <rs xml:id="lit-mort">Le Mort Darthur</rs>: symbols of Arthurian romance and mythical kingship are juxtaposed with the temporal and mundane trappings of power that resides in London and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop of Canterbury in situ when Caxton printed <rs xml:id="lit-mort">Le Mort Darthur</rs> was Thomas Bourgchier (c. 1411-1486), who served at the same time as Chancellor of England, and though he sided with <rs xml:id="lit-hen6">Henry VI</rs> in the War of the Roses, he found favour with Henry's Lancastrian successor <rs xml:id="psn-edw4">Edward IV</rs> (Clark n.p.). 
          
        Another Archbishop is to be found in Woolf's discussions of <rs xml:id="psn-hlat">Hugh Latimer</rs>'s sermons. In his Second Sermon preached before <rs xml:id="psn-edw6">King Edward</rs>, Latimer talks of 'troubl[ing] my Lord of Canterbury and being at his house, now and then I walke in the Garden looking in my booke', befire being interrupted by 'one at the gate would speake with you' (Latimer 40). Woolf uses this anecdote in her discussion of Latimer. Though Latimer does not name the Archbishop in question, it is likely to be his friend and co-reformer, Thomas Cranmer. Cranmer served <rs xml:id="psn-hen8">Henry VIII</rs> for much of his reign, first providing theological arguments in support of Henry's divorce from Katherine of Aragon. Cranmer was elevated to Archbishop of Canterbury in 1533 and did much to establish the Church of England's independence from <rs xml:id="pla-rome">Rome</rs>. Cranmer was burnt at the stake in 1556 (MacCulloch, n.p.). 
      
        Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time Woolf wrote the 'Anon' drafts was Cosmo Gordon Lang, at whom she had already taken aim in <hi rend="italics">TG</hi>. Though only referred to pseudonymously as 'An Archbishop,' Lang is one of the three photographed figures who punctuate Woolf's 1938 essay (247) and the photograph is used metonymically to refer to the Church's historical and contemporary exclusion of women.</note>

        <persName>Arthur (King)</persName>
        <note>The legendary once and future king of England. Arthurian literature is vast and diffuse: medieval sources are written in English, Latin, French, German, Norse and Icelandic, Welsh, and Breton, in a plethora of genres (cf. Bruce 507-31), from the ninth century onwards (Bruce 37). Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin <hi rend="italics">Historia Regum Brittanae</hi> (<hi rend="italics">History of the Kings of Britain</hi>; 1138) is a major early source for Arthur's 'biography' (38), but Woolf's source for Arthurian legend is <rs xml:id="psn-tmal">Thomas Malory</rs>'s <rs xml:id="lit-mort">Le Morte Darthur</rs> (1485). In Malory's account of Arthur's life, Arthur is the son of Uther Pendragon and Igraine, though Uther dies and Arthur is raised in secret. Arthur proves that he is the rightful king of England by pulling the sword from the stone (it is unclear as to whether this sword is  <rs xml:id="obj-exca">Excalibur</rs>), and his early battles. Arthur then recedes from what is putatively his own narrative: his story gives way to the various adventures and misadventures of his retinue, the knights of the <rs xml:id="obj-roun">Round Table</rs>: these include <rs xml:id="psn-lanc">Lancelot</rs>'s affair with Guinevere, Arthur's wife, and the quest for the <rs xml:id="obj-gral">Holy Grail</rs>. Eventually, Arthur discovers Lancelot's affair with Guinevere and is convinced by <rs xml:id="psn-gawa">Gawain</rs> to battle Lancelot's forces in France. With Arthur's knghts away, his son Mordred seizes the crown and Guinevere: in the ensuing battle, Arthur kills Mordred but is himself mortally wounded and is borne to Avalon, perhaps to be healed and perhaps to die and, in popular mythology, await resurrection (cf. Lacy 295-6 for a fuller summary).</note>

        <event type="death" when="1610-08-27" />
        <note>Anne Bacon was the mother of politician and philosopher <rs xml:id="psn-fbac">Francis Bacon</rs>, and a woman of great learning and intellect in her own right: she and her sisters were educated in ancient languages and theology from childhood. She published translations of the sermons of Bernadino Ochino from Italian (1548, 1551), and translated from Latin John Jewel's <hi rend="italics">Apologia Ecclesiae Anglicanae</hi> [<hi rend="italics">Apologie of the Churche of Englande (1564)</hi>]. She was an avid reformationist Puritan who sheltered preachers at <rs xml:id="pla-gorh">Gorhambury</rs>, the Bacon estate in Hertfordshire (Magnusson n.p.). Some 121 of her letters survive, which speak vividly to the intellectual and practical labour Bacon undertook both as a thinker and as the head of a wealthy household. Woolf was most likely to have encountered a selection of her letters in the first volume of Spedding's seven-volume <hi rend="italics">Life and Letters of Francis Bacon</hi> (1861-74), which the Woolfs had in their library (<hi rend="italics">LLVW</hi>). In a letter to VSW dated 19 February 1929, Woolf recollects an early memory of being lent books to read by LS from the shelves in his study, along with a pleased exclamation of ' "Gracious child, how you gobble!".' She names 'Speddings Bacon' among these volumes (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>4 27, no. 2005). She writes of Anne Bacon's letters in one of the reading notebooks she kept in preparation for the 'Anon' drafts, noting the disjunction between 'Colloquial language that comes straight from talk' and Bacon's letters (cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi>37).</note>

        <note>Francis Beaumont was an English playwright, best known for his plays written with John Fletcher, even if only nine plays in the 1647 folio <hi rend="italics">Comedies and Tragedies written by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, Gentlemen</hi> can be definitively attributed to the pair (cf. Finkelpearl, n.p.). As a figure who almost always worked in collaboration with others, his body of work has waxed and waned over the centuries. Beaumont frequented the <rs xml:id="pla-merm">Mermaid Tavern</rs>, where he reputedly met <rs xml:id="psn-bjon">Ben Jonson</rs> (cf. O'Callaghan n.p.). The Woolfs had two editions of works by (or at least attributed to) Beaumont and Fletcher in their library: an 1840 edition which had belonged to Leslie Stephen, with his annotations and drawings, and a two-volume set published as part of the Mermaid series 'The Best Plays of the Old Dramatists' and edited by John St. Loe Strachey, cousin to Lytton Strachey. VW took notes on <hi rend="italics">The Maid's Tragedy</hi> (1619, Beaumont and Fletcher) and <hi rend="italics">The Two Noble Kinsmen</hi> (1613-4?), which was attributed previously to Beaumont and Fletcher but is now attributed to <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> and Fletcher (Cf.

        <note>Ludwig van Beethoven was an Austrian composer of chamber, symphonic, and choral music, as well as one opera, the 1805 <rs xml:id="lit-fide">Fidelio</rs>, which Woolf mentions in these drafts. VW's writing displays an evident familiarity with his work, and she discusses listening to his music in diary entries and letters throughout her life. In <hi rend="italics">VO</hi>, Rachel Vinrace thinks of 'the spirit of Beethoven Op. 112' as she falls asleep (35; however cf. Hussey 14 for debate as to  the precise Opus number). In <hi rend="italics">JR</hi>, Jacob asks Bonamy ' "What about Beethoven?"' (116). In <hi rend="italics">W</hi>, Bernard purchases a 'picture of Beethoven in a silver frame' (152). In a famous passage of her unfinished memoir 'Sketch' '<rs xml:id="lit-haml">Hamlet</rs> or a Beethoven quartet' as 'the truth about the vast mass that we call the world': part of this truth is that there is 'no <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">Shakespeare</rs>; there is no Beethoven; certainly and emphatically there is no God; we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself' (<hi rend="italics">MoB</hi> 81).</note>

        <note>Thomas Bilney, known by the diminuitive nickname Little Bilney, was a priest, evangelical reformist preacher and, ultimately, martyr who was educated in Cambridge and preached across <rs xml:id="pla-norf">Norfolk</rs> and East Anglia. Having read Erasmus's Latin translation of the New Testament in 1516, Bilney became an enthusiastic reformer in Cambridge, and converted a number of his fellow scholars including <rs xml:id="psn-hlat">Hugh Latimer</rs>. By 1525, Bilney was touring East Anglia, preaching against pilgrimages and veneration of saints' remains and icons. In November 1527, he was put on trial for heresy for the first time and escaped death by renouncing his previous teachings, and was instead imprisoned for two years. In 1531, he began to preach again in the open, and was swiftly put on trial and burnt at the stake as a relapsed heretic (cf. Carter n.p.).</note>

Burton was a life-long student of Christ Church College, Oxford, where he studied theology and practiced an eclectic autodidacticism.

        <note>Lady Anne Clifford, countess of Pembroke, Dorset, and Montgomery was a woman of letters and a noblewoman associated with the court of <rs xml:id="psn-kjam">James I</rs>. Her surviving diaries, kept between January 1616 and December 1617, speak to her love of literature and vigorous autodidacticism: she writes of reading (or listening to) the Bible, contemporary literature including the <rs xml:id="lit-essa">Essays</rs> of <rs xml:id="psn-mmon">Michel de Montaigne</rs> and <rs xml:id="psn-espe">Edmund Spenser</rs>'s long poem <rs xml:id="lit-faer">The Faerie Queene</rs>, Turkish history, and the sermons of John Donne, whom she met at least once, on the 20th July 1617 (Clifford 74). For his part, Donne said of Clifford that 'she knew well how to discourse of all things, from predestination to slea-silk' (Spence n.p.). The extant portions of Clifford's diaries were written in the shadow of legal disputes sparked by her father George Clifford, third earl of Cumberland's unlawful decision to settle his estate not upon Clifford but upon his brother, Francis Clifford and Clifford's decision to challenge the will. This was a challenge that ended only with Francis Clifford's death without male heirs, upon which the lot reverted to Anne Clifford (cf. Sackville-West in Clifford, xxviii-xxx).

        The Woolfs had a copy of Sackville-West's 1924 edition of Clifford's diaries in their library: Woolf made three sets of notes on it, in preparation for <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi> and again in preparing to write the 'Anon' drafts (cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 9, 37, see also RN2.

        <note>Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a romantic poet and essayist. Relevant here are Coleridge's lectures on <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs>: from 1808 to 1891, he delivered some eight courses of lectures either dedicated to Shakespeare or discussing him in conjunction with other authors. Much of this criticism is no longer extant, though among the 20 volumes of Coleridge's various writings in <hi rend="italics">LLVW</hi> is an 1885 volume titled <hi rend="italics">Lectures and Notes on Shakspere [sic] and Other English Poets</hi>. This collects Coleridge's notes for his 1818 lectures on Shakespeare, as well as on the plays of <rs xml:id="psn-bjon">Ben Jonson</rs>, and <rs xml:id="psn-fbea">Beaumont</rs> and Fletcher. It also reproduces transcriptions of his 1811-12 Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton. The volume contains LS's annotations and drawing; however, if VW read this volume then no reading notes are extant. VW published two essays on Coleridge, at either end of her career as a writer. Her 1918 <hi rend="italics">Times Literary Supplement</hi> review 'Coleridge as Critic' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>2 221-225) specifically remarks on Coleridge's writings on Shakespeare: 'His notes upon Shakespeare are, to our thinking, the only criticisms which bear reading with the sound of the play still in one's ears. They possess one of the marks which we are apt to discover in the finest art, the power of seeming to bring to light what was already there beforehand, instead of imposing anything from the outside' (222). In <hi rend="italics">On Being Ill</hi> (1930), Coleridge's readings of Shakespeare are drowned out: 'Illness, in its kingly sublimity, sweeps all that aside and leaves nothing but Shakespeare and oneself [...] even Coleridge himself squeaks like a distant mouse' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 202). In October 1940, the <hi rend="italics">New Statesman &amp; Nation</hi> published VW's review 'The Man at the Gate' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 235-41) and the next week published 'Sara Coleridge,' VW's review of a biography of Coleridge's daughter, (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 249-255). Woolf read widely in Coleridge in preparation for her 1940 essays, writing to T.S. Eliot on 15 May 1940 that she was 'reading Coleridge through' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>6 398, no. 3608). She may have read an 1804 letter in which Coleridge writes of his plans to read Shakespeare and treat 'Each scene of each play I read, as if it were the whole of Shakespere's [sic] Works — the sole thing extant,' and read 'Ben Johnson [sic], Beaumont &amp; Fletcher, &amp; Massinger' in the same manner (Coleridge in Mahoney 501). This is a mode of reading that bears remarkable similarities to the one described in M111, set 3 of 3 [The Reader: Anonymity was a great possession], fol. 5 recto, which asks for readers to 'cease to consider the plays separately' and 'scramble them together as one common attempt,' 'as sketches for one masterpiece.'</note>

        <note>Thomas Dekker was a English poet, pamphleteer, and playwright. Little is known of his life. The most reliable source for his early years as a playwright is the diary of <rs xml:id="psn-phen">Philip Henslowe</rs>, which details Dekker's dealings with Henslowe's theatre company. By 1600 he was a combatant in the 'War of the Theatres,' writing <hi rend="italics">Satiro-mastix</hi> as a response to <rs xml:id="psn-bjon">Ben Jonson</rs>'s parody of him in <hi rend="italics">Poetaster</hi>. In spite of growing success as a pamphleteer, he spent 1613–20 in debtors' prison, and sought to reestablish himself as a playwright following his release (cf. Twyning n.p.). The Woolfs had two editions of Dekker in their library, one part of the Mermaid series 'The Best Plays of the Old Dramatists' and the other a 1924 Bodley Head reprint of his 1603 pamphlet <hi rend="italics">The VVonderful Yeare</hi>, a prose account of the death of Elizabeth I and of the plague epidemic of that year.

        It is unclear why Woolf mentions Feilding, the Earl of Denbigh in this distinctly witchy context (cf. M1-8, 1 of 10. [The great Elizabethan house, Penshurst...], fol. 4r). However, in 1594, a Gwen verch Ellis was put on trial, and possibly executed, for witchcraft in Denbigh, Wales (Parkin).

        <note>Edward Tudor was the son of Jane Seymour and, as his only male heir, the short-lived successor to <rs xml:id="psn-hen8">Henry VIII</rs> as king of England and Ireland. Though his reign was curtailed by what was most likely a combination of tuberculosis and measles or smallpox, he was nonetheless influential. He was crowned with great pomp on 19 February 1547: the <rs xml:id="psn-arch">Archbishop of Canterbury</rs>, Thomas Cramner, proclaimed him 'God's Viceregent, and Christ's Vicar,' and in this capacity oversaw much of the reformatory work Cramner had begun under the previous monarch – perhaps most significantly for the development of English as a literary language, this work included the 1549 introduction of the vernacular <hi rend="italics">Book of Common Prayer</hi> (Hoak n.p.). 
          
        In M1-8, 2 of 10. Anon.

Anon. Typescript fragment..., fol. 18r, she adds further nuance, writing that he paradoxically gave minstrels a new 'lease of life' insofar as he 'was rescuing [English] from the back door' at which Anon had sung. It is not a stretch to see Cramner's vernacular prayerbook as part of this same recovery.</note>

        <note>Elizabeth Tudor was queen of England and Ireland from 1558 to 1603, and the last Tudor monarch.

In <hi rend="italics">BA</hi>'s pageant, one Eliza Clark, 'licensed to sell tobacco' plays Elizabeth.

        <note>John Falstaff (referred to as Oldcastle in some editions) is a character in <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs>'s history plays <hi rend="italics">1 Henry IV</hi> and <hi rend="italics">2 Henry IV</hi> and his comedy <hi rend="italics">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>. He is killed offstage after <hi rend="italics">2 Henry IV</hi>: he is eulogised by his former companions in <hi rend="italics">Henry V</hi> (2.3 ll. 5-40). Thoby Stephen was evidently impressed by this: in 'Sketch' VW recounts how the '[t]hat large natural inhumanity' in Shakespeare, exemplified by 'shuffling off Falstaff [...] without a sign of sympathy [...] delighted' her brother (<hi rend="italics">MoB</hi> 152). This example of Shakespearean inhumanity is recapitulated in 'Reading' (1919), where the narrator notes that 'Shakespeare dismissed Falstaff callously enough' to evidence a 'cruelty' common to 'the great writers' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>3 158). In 'Mr Conrad: A Conversation' (1923) one of the interlocutors cites Falstaff as the originator of a 'broad and free [...] common English humour' in which Conrad, a foreigner, cannot share (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>3 379). Elsewhere, Falstaff is a potent exemplum of the force of creativity. The narrator of 'How Should One Read a Book' discusses 'the varied art of the poet; his power to make us at once actors and spectators; his power to run his hand into character as if it were a glove, and be Falstaff and <rs xml:id="lit-lear">Lear</rs>' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 579) while the variant text of 'The Antiquary' published posthumously in <hi rend="italics">The Moment and Other Essays</hi> (1947) says that Scott's characters bear the 'seed of life' like Shakespeare's but do not '[live] as profoundly, as fully, as Falstaff lives or <rs xml:id="lit-haml">Hamlet</rs>' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 435). In 'The Art of Biography' (1939), VW writes that '[e]ven <rs xml:id="psn-sjoh">Dr Johnson</rs> created by Boswell will not live as long as Falstaff as created by Shakespeare' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 187).</note>

        <note>Little is known about Ingram Frizer's life, save that he killed <rs xml:id="psn-cmar">Christopher Marlowe</rs> in what is popularly believed to have been a tavern brawl on 30 May 1593 in <rs xml:id="pla-dept">Deptford</rs>, London, although more recently this popular conception has been called into question (cf. Nicholl, n.p.). Though it may have taken place in private rather than a tavern, the specific details of Frizer's fight with Marlowe are less doubtful. In M108 [The Reader: There is a jolt at the points.], fol. 5v, Woolf paraphrases G.B. Harrison's account of Marlowe's death, itself a paraphrase of contemporary court records: 'malicious words passed between Marlowe and Frizer about the payment of the reckoning, until Marlowe [...] sprang on Frizer [...] and taking Frizer's dagger from his back wounded him twice in the head. Frizer being then put in fear of his life strove to get his dagger back, and in the struggle gave Marlowe a mortal wound over the right eye of which he instantly died' (G.B. Harrison, 258). Woolf read and took notes on G.B. Harrison's <hi rend="italics">An Elizabethan Journal</hi> (1928) in 1940, in preparation for the 'Anon' drafts (cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi>37), and had a copy of his 1923 <hi rend="italics">Shakespeare's Fellows: Being a Brief Chronicle of the Shakespearean Age</hi> in her library (cf. <hi rend="italics">LLVW</hi>).</note>

        <note>John Gower was a trilingual poet who wrote Latin, French, and English poems of extraordinary length: the Latin <hi rend="italics">Vox Clamantis</hi> [The Crying Voice] is over 10,000 lines long, while the Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italics">Mirour de l'Omme</hi> [The Mirror of Man] and the Middle English <hi rend="italics">Confessio Amantis</hi> [The Lover's Confession] are both roughly 30,000 lines in length. Little documentary evidence survives to speak to his life, though he was evidently friends with <rs xml:id="psn-gcha">Geoffrey Chaucer</rs>. In one manuscript tradition of <hi rend="italics">Confessio Amantis</hi>, Gower dedicates the poem to Chaucer, as the speaker asks Venus to 'gret wel Chaucer whan ye mete | As mi disciple and mi poete' (Gower 1.8, note to ll. 2941), while the penultimate stanza of Chaucer's <hi rend="italics">Troilus and Criseyde</hi> apostrophises Gower and dedicates the poem to him: 'O moral Gower, this book I directe | To the [...] | To vouchen sauf, there nede is, to correct | Of youre benignites and zeles goode' (Chaucer V.1856-8).</note>

        <note>Philip Henslowe was a theatre financier and patron, whose diary provides an invaluable window into the business of the Jacobean stage. Henslowe financed and took an active interest in the construction of the <rs xml:id="pla-rose">Rose</rs> playhouse in <rs xml:id="pla-sout">Southwark</rs>, and its resident theatre company, Lord Strange's Men, later the Lord Admiral's Men. In 1600, he began work on another playhouse, the <rs xml:id="pla-fort">Fortune</rs>, as a joint venture with the actor Edward Alleyn. Henslowe was a success at the court of <rs xml:id="psn-kjam">King James</rs>, being appointed as gentleman sewer of the chamber in 1603 and jointly purchasing the mastership of the royal game with Alleyn, which would enable them to license bear baiting, in 1604 – they held baiting at the Rose fortnightly (cf. Cerasano n.p.) Henslowe's diary is somewhat of a composite volume: it contains accounts kept by a John Henslowe regarding the 'felling and disposal of timber and other matters in Ashdown forest' from 1576-1581, and thereafter contains a mixture of what Greg describes as 'accounts and memoranda relating both to private affairs, dramatic and other' from 1592 to 1609. It contains accounts of family business, matters relating to the Rose and the performances therein, details of monies lent and received, astrological formulae, medical recipes and charms, and details of a joint starch-making venture he undertook with Alleyn. The small folio volume lay undiscovered in the archives of Dulwich College, a boys' school in London, until 1780 where they remain today (Greg in Henslowe i.xii-xxiii). Woolf read the two-volume edition of Henslowe's diary edited by <rs xml:id="psn-greg">W. W. Greg</rs> in preparation for her work on the 'Anon' drafts, gleaning much of her information on the material conditions of the early stage from Greg's exhaustive commentary on the diary (Cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi>14, 37).</note>

        <note>Norweigian playwright whose work was received enthusiastically by VW and by Bloomsbury more broadly. In his autobiography LW describes the plays' impact on his Cambridge contemporaries. They contained 'something else, something extraordinarily exciting which belonged to the immediate moment in which we lived and yet went down into the depths of our beliefs and desires and the great currents of history [...] the cobwebs and the veils, the pretences and hypocrisies which suppressed the truth, buttressed cruelty, injustice, and stupidity, and suffocated society in the nineteenth century, were broken through, exposed, swept away' (Leonard Woolf i.163).

        Though VW does not write in a sustained fashion on Ibsen, he appears throughout her works. VW takes notes on <hi rend="italics">Hedda Gabler</hi> (1891; cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 47) in 1924, in preparation for <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi> and on <hi rend="italics">The Master Builder</hi> (1892; cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 25). She scribbles the name of <hi rend="italics">The Wild Duck</hi> on the back of notes on E.M. Forster's <hi rend="italics">Where Angels Fear to Tread</hi> (1894; cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 15): in 'The Novels of E.M. Forster' (1927) she makes a sustained comparison between novelist and playwright, writing  that Forster's 'closest affinity' is with Ibsen insofar as they share a 'combination of realism and mysticism,' and mentions both <hi rend="italics">The Master Builder</hi> and <hi rend="italics">The Wild Duck</hi> by name: whereas these plays create a 'sense of instant certainty,' there is an 'ambiguity at the heart of Mr Forster's novels' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 495-7). In 'Hours in a Library' (1916), Woolf's hypothetical young reader reads 'the whole of Ibsen' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>2 56), and in 'Poetry, Fiction and the Future' (1927) she writes of Ibsen's dramatic prose (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 438). In <hi rend="italics">VO</hi>, Rachel Vinrace reads a 'brightly-covered red volume lettered on the back <hi rend="italics">Works of Henrik Ibsen</hi>' (136), and in <hi rend="italics">ND</hi> Cyril Alardyce proposes to Katharine Hilbery's aunt Celia by means of a letter ' "full of quotations"' of ' "Ibsen and Butler"' (110). She writes two diary entries with the imperative that she 'must' read Ibsen: in her entry of 28 August 1922 she wants to compare him with Euripides (<hi rend="italics">D</hi>2 196), and on 28 November 1928 she writes that she 'must read Ibsen &amp; <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">Shakespeare</rs> &amp; Racine' (<hi rend="italics">D</hi>3 210). In a letter to Quentin Bell dated 8 March 1934, she describes Lydia Lopkova's performance as Nora in a recent production of <hi rend="italics">A Doll's House</hi>: 'she was a marvel, not only a light leaf in the wind, but edged, profound, and her English was exactly what Ibsen meant——it gave the right aroma' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>5 282, §. 2863). The only play of Ibsen's to which she refers by name herein is <rs xml:id="lit-ghos">Ghosts</rs> (1881), which she does not discuss elsewhere.
          
        LLVW contains a standalone copy of his <hi rend="italics">The Master Builder</hi> and a twelve-volume <hi rend="italics">Collected Works</hi> in their library (1906-12) which is missing the eleventh volume: in a letter dated 09 December 1914 she suggests that Clive Bell might have it: 'I noticed that you have No. 11 in the red edition of Ibsen——which is missing from our set. Is it possible that someone staying at Asheham took it away with them? You seemed only to have odd volumes, so I thought it possible' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>2 54, §. 713).</note>

        <note>An Anglo-American novelist whose long literary relationship with the Stephen family and hence with VW began as early as August 1878 when <hi rend="italics">The Cornhill Magazine</hi>, edited by Leslie Stephen, printed his novella <hi rend="italics">Daisy Miller</hi> (Edel 1.274). After James's relocation to Europe, he became a frequent visitor at Hyde Park Gate and Talland House (Annan 108). In 'Sketch' VW recalls the 'hesitations and adumbrations with which [he] made the living room [of Hyde Park Gate] seem rich and dusky' (<hi rend="italics">MoB</hi> 173). One of her earliest publications was a 1905 review of <rs xml:id="lit-gold">The Golden Bowl</rs>, and she describes visiting him in a 1907 letter sent to Violet Dickinson (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>1 306, §. 380). In a 1915 letter she asks Lytton Strachey to '[p]lease tell me what merit you find in Henry James. I have disabused Leonard of him; but we have his works here [at Asheham], and I read, and can't find anything but faintly tinged rose water, urbane and sleek, but vulgar and as pale as Walter Lamb' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>2 67, §. 732). She continues to write on Henry James throughout her career, both in essays specifically devoted to his work (cf. 'The Old Order' [1917; <hi rend="italics">E</hi>3 167-76], 'Within the Rim' [1919; <hi rend="italics">E</hi>3 22-5], 'The Letters of Henry James' [1920; <hi rend="italics">E</hi>3 198-207], 'Henry James's Ghost Stories' [1921; <hi rend="italics">E</hi>3 319-26]), an essay on critical assessments of his work ('The Method of Henry James' [1918; <hi rend="italics">E</hi>2 346-9]), and in essays on the history and development of literature. In 'Hours in a Library' (1916), she writes that James was 'of course alive when this reader came to [him]' but nevertheless was 'already accepted among the classics' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>2 57). The <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi> essay 'The Patron and the Crocus' compares James to Samuel Butler and George Meredith: '[e]ach despised the public; each desired a public; each failed to attain a public; and each wreaked his failure upon the public' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 213). In 'Is Fiction an Art?' (1927), Woolf's review of E.M. Forster's <hi rend="italics">Aspects of the Novel</hi>, Woolf critiques Forster's 'notably harsh judgment of Henry James' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 461). In her long 1929 essay 'Phases of Fiction,' Woolf lists James among the 'psychologists' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 63) alongside Proust and Dostoevsky. She took notes on 12 of his works at various points in her life, and LLVW contains 24 separate editions of his works. In 1924, the Hogarth Press published <hi rend="italics">Henry James at Work</hi>, a biographical essay by Theodora Bosquanet, who acted as James's amanuensis 1907-16.</note>

        <note>Though VW never writes an essay dedicated to Samuel Johnson, the figure of this essayist, biographer, playwright, poet, editor (most notably of <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">Shakespeare</rs>), and 'harmless drudge' (Johnson 'Lexicographer') nonetheless looms large in the richly populated landscape of her essays. The title of Woolf's two volumes of literary-historical essays invokes the Johnsonian common reader, whom she discusses in the preface to <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi>. Writing of Gray's 'Elegy [Written in a Country Churchyard],' Johnson 'rejoice[s] to concur with the common reader; for by the common sense of readers uncorrupted with literary prejudices, after all the refinements of subtilty and the dogmatism of learning, must be finally decided all claim to poetical honours' (Johnson 'Gray' 385). VW expands on this invocation, writing of the common reader's 'instinct to create for himself, out of whatever odds and ends he can come by, some kind of whole' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>2 19), and this mode of reparative reading guides the <hi rend="italics">CR</hi> essays. Woolf quotes from his life of Joseph Addison in her <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi> essay 'Addison' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 110-3), while he is among the guests in the essay 'Dr Burney's Evening Party'(1929, expanded for inclusion in <hi rend="italics">CR2</hi>). We see Fanny Burney reading his novel <hi rend="italics">Rasselas</hi> (1759) and writing Johnsonian sentences (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 431), while he and Hester Thrale Piozzi appear in person later in the essay: Thrale Piozzi sings arias while Johnson remains silent and 'certainly almost blind' (438-43). The last of Woolf's essays to be published in her lifetime was 'Mrs Thrale' (1941; <hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 292-7), a review of a life of Hester Thrale Piozzi, with whom Johnson had a close friendship for many years. On the verso of M109 [The Reader: At what point in Elizabethan drama...], fol. 1 is a portion of the TS for this essay. VW cites an instance of Johnsonian misogyny in <hi rend="italics">Room</hi> when she quotes from Cecil Gray's <hi rend="italics">Survey of Contemporary Music</hi>: "Of Mlle. Germaine Tailleferre one can only repeat Dr. Johnson's dictum concerning a woman preacher, transposed into terms of music. 'Sir, a woman's composing is like a dog's walking on his hind legs. It is not done well, but you are surprised to find it done at all.'" (50, cf. also Goldman 47-56 for more instances of dancing dogs). Johnson's dictum was originally reproduced in James Boswell's <hi rend="italics">Life of Samuel Johnson</hi>, a work to which VW returns throughout her career. In 'The Art of Biography' (1939), she writes that Lytton Strachey's <hi rend="italics">Eminent Victorians</hi> (1918) will 'do for the old Queen [Victoria] what Boswell did for the old dictionary maker,' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 184) although neither would 'live as long as <rs xml:id="psn-fals">Falstaff</rs> by Shakespeare' (186). Leslie Stephen wrote an 1878 biography of Johnson for the <hi rend="italics">English Men of Letters</hi> series, and his <hi rend="italics">Hours in a Library</hi> contains an essay on Johnson.</note>

        <note>William Kempe was an actor on the Elizabethan stage, who began his career as a 'jesting plaier' at courts in Europe. By 1594, he was part of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> and Richard Burbage's theatre company. He is known to have played the roles of Peter, the Nurse's servant in <rs xml:id="lit-rome">Romeo and Juliet</rs> and Dogberry in <hi rend="italics">Much Ado About Nothing</hi>, and it is conjectured that he played Bottom and Falstaff. By 1599 he had sold his share of the lease of the <rs xml:id="pla-glob">Globe</rs> and left the company. Kemp returned to clowning and his next public appearance was a highly unlikely one: in 1600, he performed a morris dance from <rs xml:id="pla-lond">London</rs> to <rs xml:id="pla-norw">Norwich</rs>, a journey of roughly 130 miles. He advertised this in a pamphlet, <hi rend="italics">Kemp's Nine Daies Wonder</hi>. The precise date of his death is unknown, though it is likely that he died in 1603, a particularly bad plague year (Eccles III 293-5).</note>

His letters to Mary Fytton evidence quite a different relationship: one of an unrequited love for her. The letters went unanswered and Fytton left the court after only a very short stint there. The letters from Fytton's mother imply that she left the court in disgrace.</note>

        <note>Little can be established for certain about the life of the author of <rs xml:id="lit-mort">Le Morte Darthur</rs>, beyond that which can be gathered from evidence internal to the book itself. Certainly, he was 'called Thomas Malory, he was a knight and a prisoner, and he finished his work dring the ninth year of King <rs xml:id="psn-edw4">Edward IV</rs>'s reign' (Lacy 294). While there were 'six Thomas Malorys known to have been alive at the same time' (294), the most likely candidate was Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel. Though this Malory was a knight and MP early in life, by 1450 he had evidently had a startling change of heart and, on 4 January 1550 attempted to ambush and murder the Duke of Buckingham. He followed this with an eighteen month crime spree which encompassed 'extortion, theft, rape, cattle rustling, robbery of the local abbey, and deer stealing and enormous damage to property' (Field n.p.). He spent the rest of his life in and out of prisons: while out of prison he joined Edward IV and the Lancastrians in his war against Henry VI and the Yorkists. His fortunes varied dramatically depending on which side was ascendant. It is thought that he wrote the <hi rend="italics">Morte</hi> in the <rs xml:id="pla-towe">Tower of London</rs>, having been imprisoned without charge during the interregnum when Henry VI was restored to power (Field n.p.)</note>

He was killed in a bar brawl by <rs xml:id="psn-ifriz">Ingram Frizer</rs>: cf. note on Frizer for the gory details. Woolf first mentions Marlowe in a November 1901 letter to her brother Thoby Stephen, in which she writes that she has read '<rs xml:id="lit-faus">Dr Faustus</rs> and <hi rend="italics">Edward II</hi>' and thinks 'them very near the great man [<rs xml:id="psn-wsha">Shakespeare</rs>]——with more humanity I should say——not all on such a grand tragic scale' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>1 46, §. 39). She does not mention <hi rend="italics">Edward II</hi> again. In August 1923 reads and takes notes on the second part of <rs xml:id="lit-tamb">Tamburlaine</rs> and <hi rend="italics">Faustus</hi> (cf. individual play entries for details), as well as <hi rend="italics">The Jew of Malta</hi>: she writes that Marlowe 'cant combine his lyrics with the structural framework of a tragedy' and sums up Barabas as 'having a great power of displaying hate' (<hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 25, fol. 32). She also takes notes on his long poem <hi rend="italics">Hero and Leander</hi> in the same notebook.

        In <hi rend="italics">VO</hi>, Marlowe's works are to be found in Ambrose Ridley's library, though he is unsure quite why they are there (192) and he is among the dead whose names are enumerated in 'The Evening Party' (<hi rend="italics">CSF</hi> 100). In <hi rend="italics">JR</hi>, he is a favourite of Jacob Flanders, who transcribes and 'collate[s] editions of Marlowe in the British Museum,' the outcome of which is an 'incredibly dull essay' (173-4). In <hi rend="italics">O</hi>, Marlowe is a literary hero of the young Orlando, and an associate of Nick Greene, who calls Marlowe a 'likely boy, but what can you say of a lad who died before he was thirty' (81-2). He recounts an anecdote of 'a night at the <rs xml:id="pla-cock">Cock Tavern</rs> in Fleet Street when Kit Marlowe was there and some others.' Drunkenly, Marlowe says to Shakespeare ' "Stap my vitals, Bill [...] There's a great wave coming and you're on top of it"' (82-3). He is mentioned as a forerunner necessary for Shakespeare to be able to write in <hi rend="italics">Room</hi> (59) and he is among the dramatists whose plays Donne sees in the <hi rend="italics">CR2</hi> essay 'Donne after Three Centuries' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 351).

        LLVW contains two collected editions of Marlowe, one of which is an 'unexpurgated' edition by sexologist Havelock Ellis, as well as a standalone edition of <hi rend="italics">Hero and Leander</hi>. In addition it contains a copy of Leslie Hotson's <hi rend="italics">The Death of Christopher Marlowe</hi> (1925) which VW used as a source herein (cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 37).</note>

        <note>John Marston was a poet, playwright and priest perhaps best known for his long-running literary feud with <rs xml:id="psn-bjon">Ben Jonson</rs>. It is likely that Marston satirically portrayed Jonson in <hi rend="italics">Histriomastix</hi>, and that Marston was the target of several of Jonson's satirical forays. This, however, did not stop Marston from providing a prefatory poem to Jonson's <hi rend="italics">Sejanus</hi> (1605) or dedicating his own play, <hi rend="italics">The Malcontent</hi> (1603-4) to him. The latter play, a dark comedy, was one of Marston's most successful plays. By 1609, Marston had become ordained as a priest, and thereafter he slowly fades from the historical record (Knowles n.p.). The Woolfs' library contains an 1856 three-volume edition of Marston's plays, signed and annotated by Leslie Stephen.

        <note>Thomas Middleton is credited as the only English renaissance playwright other than <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> to have 'created plays still considered masterpieces in four major dramatic genres: comedy, history, tragedy, and tragicomedy' (Taylor in Middleton i.25): he also wrote prose satire, masques and pageants. He collaborated with Shakespeare, writing part of <hi rend="italics">Timon of Athens</hi>, and sold Shakespeare's company, The King's Men, the text of <rs xml:id="lit-reve">The Revenger's Tragedy</rs> to perform, thereby beginning a commercial and artistic partnership that would endure past Shapespeare's death in 1616. Middleton was 'apparently the only playwright trusted by the King's Men to update Shakespeare's plays after his death' (Taylor n.p.). Middleton's final play, <hi rend="italics">A Game at Chess</hi> was his greatest commercial success but also proved his downfall. A theological and political satire that gives the Spanish Match, an unsuccessful attempt by <rs xml:id="psn-jam">King James I</rs> to ally Protestant England and Catholic Spain through marriage, allegorical form as a chess game. The play sees England and Spain locked in a ritualised, carefully choreographed intrigue – the play's characters are chess pieces moving across a board, struggling for advantage and to avoid '[t]he bag [which], like hell-mouth, opens | To take her due' (5.3.179-80). The play was performed for an unprecedented nine days, from 5-14th August 1624, before it was closed down. The Privy Council ordered a manhunt for Middleton, after which he was probably imprisoned: thereafter he stopped writing for the stage (Taylor n.p.). Unlike many of his contemporaries, VW did not make reading notes on Middleton (or at least none are extant), and none of his works are catalogued in their library.</note>

        <note>VW read, quoted from and alluded to William Shakespeare's works almost constantly throughout her life, as well as imagining for him a sister whose mute voice is metonymic of women's writing throughout literary history. Fox describes the playwright as part of the 'atmosphere' of Hyde Park Gate (94) and details VW's early ambivalence she felt towards him (94-6), an ambivalence which she had yet to overcome by 1909 when she took notes on <rs xml:id="lit-haml">Hamlet</rs>, <rs xml:id="lit-lear">King Lear</rs> <rs xml:id="lit-macb">Macbeth</rs>, <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi>, and <rs xml:id="lit-rome">Romeo and Juliet</rs>, alongside <rs xml:id="psn-acbr">A.C. Bradley</rs>'s <hi rend="italics">Shakespearean Tragedy</hi> (cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 29). Woolf never writes an essay specifically on Shakespeare, and the later drafts herein begin to give a reason for this: 
          
        M112, Set 1 of 3 argues Shakespearean criticism is always inadequate and that 
          
          One reason why Shakespeare is still read is simply
          the inadequacy of Shakespearean criticism. The inadequacy of
          that criticism is means that is due of course to the
          it is always autobiographical criticism

          (M112 [The Reader]. Typescript fragment with the author's ms. corrections, unsigned and undated. 5p. fol. 1 recto)
          
        In M111, Set 1 of 3, Shakespeare is read to 'testify [...] to the enormous possibilities of speed' and VW asserts that the 'truest account of reading Shakespeare' would not resemble a conventional book 'with a beginning middle and end' but rather a collection of 'notes':

          used for more general purposes--when the ink has gone dry
          upon the pen to revive the sense of language; or to
          testify, when words seem motionless, to the enormous
          possibilities of speed. One reading always supersedes another
          Thus the truest account of reading Shakespeare would be
          not to write a book with a beginning middle and end;
          but to collect notes, without trying to make them
          consistent. 

          (M111 Set 1 of 3, [The Reader: But her own passion, the disgrace, the humiliation...]. fol. 1 verso)
          
        Froula argues that '[f]igures of Shakespeare are often figures of Woolf: moments of oblique <hi rend="italics">self</hi>-portraiture that catch important features of her artistic self-fashioning. Throughout her life Woolf drew upon Shakespeare's art to inspire and measure her own, even as she pressed beyond the limits of his male-centered characters and plots' (123, cf. also Briggs).
        
        LLVW contains 39 separate editions of works by Shakespeare, including collected editions of his plays and standalone editions of 21 of the 38 plays he is known to have written.

LLVW also contains the first volume of a 1873 two-volume set of his poetry. LW's brother was called Philip Sidney Woolf, and in her letter describing Vita Sackville-West (and her legs) to Jacques Raverat, she tells Raverat that Sackville-West 'descends from Dorset, Buckingham, Sir Philip Sidney, and the whole of English history' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>3 150, §. 1520; 26 December 1924).</note>

        <note>Bartholomew Oliver's Afghan Hound named Sohrab. The <hi>locus classicus</hi> for the name Sohrab is Matthew Arnold's 1853 quasi-Miltonic epic poem 'Sohrab and Rustum.' Woolf knew this poem: her library contain's Arnold's 1859 Poems, which prints 'Sohrab and Rustum,' while she reports in a diary entry of 9th May 1897 that Leslie Stephen recited the poem 'after dinner' (PA 83). Arnold's poem relates how Rustum, an Iranian warrior, killed Sohrab, a warrior in the Tatar host and the son Rustum did not know he had, in single combat (Arnold 302-331). The name Sohrab is a double intertext: within Woolf's own corpus it recalls Old Rustum in Orlando (cf. O 131), the gypsy who disabuses the newly female Orlando of her pride in what she had previously considered her illustrious heritage (O 136). As a further doggy aside, Orlando has a 'seluchi' (or saluki) in Turkey (O 129)—a type of sighthound related to the Afghan hound.</note>

        <note>Saint George is the patron saint of England, whose saint's day is celebrated on 23 April (incidentally, the day on which <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">Shakespeare</rs> is thought to have been born and died). In popular legend, Saint George is known for slaying a dragon. The 'Saint Georges play' to which Woolf refers is a mummer's play which stages a battle between crusader forces, led by Saint George, and Turkish knights. In Hardy's <hi rend="italics">Return of the Native</hi> (1878), the Edgon mummers rehearse and perform the 'well-known play of Saint George' at Christmas (157 et passim). Saint George is introduced by '[h]ump-backed Father Christmas [...] swinging [a] huge club, and in a general way clearing the stage for the actors proper' (171). Hardy's narrative excerpts extensively from the play, and we see Saint George vanquish all comers — but Hardy does not dwell on the miraculous resurrection of the dead that occurs at the end of the play (171-4). VW read and took notes on Hardy's novels between February 1919 and January 1921 in readiness for an eventual obituary she had been comissioned to write for <hi rend="italics">TLS</hi> on February 14 1919, when the ' "evil hour"' of Hardy's death came (cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 42). The obituary was not published until 11 January 1928 (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 507-19, cf. 517 n. 1), and it was reprinted in <hi rend="italics">CR2</hi> (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 561-72). In 1928, theatrical publisher Samuel French printed an edition of the <hi rend="italics">Play of St. George</hi> whose text was provided by Hardy, based in no small part on the mummery scene in <hi rend="italics">Return</hi>. The 1928 edition also contained a 'modernized' version of the play that features among its dramatis personae <rs xml:id="psn-kart">King Arthur</rs> and Mussolini (Hardy and Loomis). There is no evidence VW encountered this peculiar text.</note>

        <note>Irish poet and playwright who had close connections to Ottoline Morrell's circle at Garsington. In a letter sent 29 April 1919 she writes to Morrell that she has 'been reading Yeats new poems [<hi rend="italics">The Wild Swans at Coole</hi> (1917)] with great pleasure. I think — for the first time — that he really is a poet' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>2 352, §. 1041). In December 1926, VW reads his <hi rend="italics">Autobiographies: Reveries Over Childhood &amp; The Trembling of the Veil</hi> (1911, 1922). Although she writes in her diary that 'some superstition prevents [her] from reading' it, she nonetheless describes it as a 'very good book — very close &amp; measured speech' (<hi rend="italics">D</hi>3 118 <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 25 102). They met (though not for the first time) on 7 November 1930 at Garsington. VW describes this meeting in her diary entry the next day and seems almost star-struck, describing him as 'very broad; very thick; like a solid piece of oak' with 'luminous, direct' eyes. Of note here is their discussion of poetry and its periodisation: Yeats argues that Milton's 'Latinised' poetry 'damaged the English language' and that 'the great age of poetry; Shakespeare's age, was subjective; ours is objective; civilisations end when they become objectified. Woolf is hugely impressed by 'this large actively minded immensely vitalised man. Wherever one cut him, with a little question, he poured, spouted fountains of ideas. And I was impressed by his directness, his terseness. No fluff &amp; dreaminess.' (<hi rend="italics">D</hi>3 329-30). She writes enthusiastically of this meeting to Vanessa Bell and to Ethel Smyth (<hi rend="italics">L</hi> 4 250, §. 2274; 253, §. 2277). They meet again on 25 October 1934: he 'has been writing about [Woolf]. The Waves. That comes after Stendhal. I see what you're at — But I want more humanity' (<hi rend="italics">D</hi>4 255). Her letter to Ethel Smyth dated 01 November 1934 ends 'Did I tell you I met Yeats, at Ottolines? And he said (this is my vanity) "I'm writing about The Waves; which...." Now I took that for a compliment, on the lips of our greatest living poet' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>5 343, §. 2946). LLVW contains seven volumes by Yeats, and the Hogarth Press published L. A. G.

        <note><rs xml:id="psn-wsha">Shakespeare</rs>'s tragedy dramatises the deadly romance between Roman triumvir Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, queen of Egypt from 51-30 BCE, and the final days of Ptolemaic Egypt as it is conquered by Rome. The play was probably composed between 1606 and 1607, though it was first printed in the First Folio in 1623. Woolf cites both the play and the character of Cleopatra frequently in her novels and essays. 
          
        In <hi rend="italics">MD</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> proves a formative experience for Septimus Warren Smith. He is taught literature by Isabel Pole, with whom he 'fall[s] in love.' She 'give[s] him a taste of <hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> and the rest' and 'lit in him such a fire that burns only once in a lifetime, without heat, flickering a red-gold flame infinitely ethereal and insubstantial over Miss Pole; <hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>; and the Waterloo Road' (<hi rend="italics">MD</hi> 76). Septimus is reading the play on the day that <hi rend="italics">MD</hi> is set, although with less satisfaction. As he opens the play, he thinks: 'That boy's business of the intoxication of language——<hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>——had shrivelled utterly' (79). Mauck draws parallels between the characters of Septimus and Antony (Mauck 343). In <hi rend="italics">W</hi>, meanwhile, Neville cites both Shakespeare's play and <hi rend="italics">The Waste Land</hi> simultaneously in saying 'here in a car comes Cleopatra, burning on her barge' (157). In <hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>, Enobarbarus describes how the 'barge [Cleopatra] sat in, like a burnished throne | Burned upon the water; its poop was beaten gold' (ii.II 201-2) while Eliot writes of '[t]he Chair she in, like a burnished throne | Glowed upon the marble' (CHECK decent eliot ed. ll. 77-8). After the pageant in <hi rend="italics">BA</hi>, <rs xml:id="psn-lucy">Lucy Swithin</rs> seeks out <rs xml:id="psn-latr">La Trobe</rs> to congratulate her on the pageant. Swithin can only 'lay[] hold to a fraction of her meaning' but La Trobe interpolates: Swithin is trying to say 'I could have played... Cleopatra' and that she has 'stirred in me my unacted part' (110).
          
        VW's 1916 essay 'Hours in a Library' describes the 'absolute certainty of delight which breathes through us when we come back to' works of literature: as well as works by Milton and <rs xml:id="psn-tbro">Thomas Browne</rs>, the narrator cites <hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>2 60). The <hi rend="italics">CR</hi> essay 'The Patron and the Crocus' uses the play as an exemplum of 'how much grammar Shakespeare violated' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 215). <hi rend="italics">On Being Ill</hi> (1930) discusses the experience of reading 'in illness, with the police off duty.' The ill reader experiences words 'sensually first, by way of the palate and the nostrils, like some queer odour. Foreigners, to whom the tongue is strange, have' the native speaker of English 'at a disadvantage. The Chinese must know the sound of <hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> better than we do' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 202). In 'A Letter to a Young Poet' (1932), the narrator compares self-centred, inward-looking, modern poetry to past literature whose 'pages were crammed with characters of the most opposite and various kinds——<rs xml:id="lit-haml">Hamlet</rs>, Cleopatra, <rs xml:id="psn-fals">Falstaff</rs>" (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 315).  Woolf's essay on Ellen Terry (1941) concludes with the observation that other actors are 'remembered because they were <rs xml:id="lit-haml">Hamlet</rs>, Phèdre, or Cleopatra' but Terry is 'rembembered becassue she was Ellen Terry' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 - CHECK). In 'Craftsmanship' (1937), Woolf toys with the prospect of 'plays more splendid than <hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>' that lie waiting to be discovered in the dictionary (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 CHECK).

        Meanwhile, the play is a key intertext for <hi rend="italics">Room</hi>. Cleopatra is listed among the 'women who have burnt like beacons in all the works of all the poets from the beginning of time' (39), part of a 'queer, composite being' who is at once '[i]maginatively of the highest importance' but 'in real life could hardly read, could scarcely spell, and was the property of her husband' (40). The narrator inquires about Shakespeare's 'state of mind [...] when he wrote <rs xml:id="lit-lear">Lear</rs> and <hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>' (46), and later answers her inquiry while looking at the playtext: 'the mind of an artist, in order to achieve the prodigious effort of freeing whole and entire the work that is in him, must be incandescent, like Shakespeare's mind' (51). Later in the essay, the narrator contemplates the phrase ' "Chloe liked Olivia"' and how 'immense a change' this phrase brings with it: 'Chloe liked Olivia perhaps for the first time in literature.' She compares this to Cleopatra, who 'did not like Octavia,' her rival for Antony's love. 'And how completely <hi rend="italics">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> would have been altered,' the narrator continues 'had she done so!' (74). Throughout <hi rend="italics">Room</hi>, Cleopatra comes to act as synecdoche for women in literary history.</note>

LW writes in his autobiography that 'night after night we flocked to Covent Garden' in 1911, 'entranced by a new art, a revelation to us benighted British, the Russian Ballet in the greatest days of Diaghilev and Nijinsky' (Leonard Woolf in Hussey 244). Nadel (2018) provides a fuller account of the company's radically modern approach to dance, arguing that they 'radically broke with a Germanic orchestral tradition, causing writersto readjust their modernist values' (552).</note>

        <note>Shortwave radio became a viable communicative medium only in the 1920s but quickly became what Trotter (2013) calls 'the most momentuous of all new media, in economic, political, and military terms,' radically reconfiguring empire (14). In the metropole, the BBC was established in 1922: Avery (2009) traces Bloomsbury's rich involvement with the corporation. VW gave three broadcast talks. The first was a conversation with LW titled 'Are Too Many Books Written and Published' (1927, cf. <hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 609-16); the second an essay on Beau Brummell (1929 cf. <hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 618-24); and the last was 'Craftsmanship' (1937, cf. <hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 624-7). In 'Poetry, Fiction, and the Future' (1927), modernity is figured as a 'long avenue of brick [...] cut up into boxes, each of which is inhabited by a different human being [...] yet is linked to his fellows by wires which pass overhead by waves of sound [...] which speak to him of battles and murders and strikes and revolutions all over the world' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 432-4, cf. Koppen 145), while in <hi rend="italics">TG</hi> the 'wireless' forms part of a  'public psychometer' that the letter-writer urges her interlocutor to 'consult' (206). Its 'clamour' and 'uproar' transmits the profoundly antifeminist 'infantile fixation' across Britain and Europe, the voice of patriarchy giving way to 'no language but a cry, Ay, ay, ay, ay' (269). In 'Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid' (1940) a verbal 'current flows fast and furious [issuing] in a spate of words from the loudspeakers,' and 'tell[ing] us that we are a free people, fighting to defend freedom' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi> 243). Suffice it to say the narrator is not convinced of this.</note>

        <note>A long prose pastoral romance (punctuated by songs) that <rs xml:id="psn-psid">Philip Sidney</rs> dedicated to his sister <rs xml:id="psn-mher">Mary Herbert Sidney</rs>, the Countess of Pembroke. The poem is extant in two variants. Sidney most likely started drafting the first, which became known as the <hi rend="italics">Old Arcadia</hi> in 1577 and finished drafting it in 1580. This edition circulated in manuscript form, but was not published until Albert Feuillerat's 1912 edition. Sidney attempted to rewrite the <hi rend="italics">Old Arcadia</hi>, starting between 1582 and 1584. He did not finish before his death in 1586 though posthumous editors filled in the gaps: these editions have come to be known as the <hi rend="italics">New Arcadia</hi> (Evans in Sidney <hi rend="italics">Arcadia</hi> 10-13). LLVW contains two editions of <hi rend="italics">The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia</hi>: a tenth edition from 1655 and an eleventh edition from 1662. VW took notes on the former of these editions in preparation for her <hi rend="italics">CR2</hi> essay 'The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia' (<hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 8; <hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 366-76). While this does not preclude Woolf having read the Feuillerat <hi rend="italics">Old Arcadia</hi> it seems highly probable that she refers exclusively to the later set of variants when she discusses the <hi rend="italics">Arcadia</hi>. In her <hi rend="italics">CR2</hi> essay, she writes that 'in the <hi rend="italics">Arcadia</hi>, as in some luminous globe, all the seeds of English fiction lie latent. We can trace infinite possibilities: it may take one of many different directions' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 373). She quotes from the <hi rend="italics">Arcadia</hi> in the opening of <hi rend="italics">F</hi>: 'That there was an aristocracy of dogs by the time <rs xml:id="psn-eliz">Queen Elizabeth</rs> was on the throne Sir Philip Sidney bears witness '... greyhounds, Spaniels and Hounds', he observes, 'where-of the first might seem the Lords, the second the Gentlemen, and the last the Yeomen of dogs', he writes in the <hi rend="italics">Arcadia</hi>' (7).</note>

        <note><rs xml:id="psn-psid">Philip Sidney</rs> did not title his long essay on poetry. It was published posthumously in 1595 in two separate editions, one known as <hi rend="italics">An Apology for Poetry</hi> and the other as <hi rend="italics">The Defense of Poesy</hi> (Maslen in Sidney <hi rend="italics">Apology</hi> 1, n. 1): the edition that VW reads and takes notes on in preparation for <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi> calls it <hi rend="italics">The Defence of Poesie</hi> (Sidney 'Defence' [1655 ed.] 540; cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 47). Particularly relevant to Woolf's argument in the 'Anon' fragments is Sidney's lengthy digression in which he takes the time to 'inquire why England (the mother of excellent minds) should be grown so hard a stepmother to poets' (Sidney <hi rend="italics">Apology</hi> 108): VW often notes that, during the period that her Common History drafts cover, examples of literary writing in English are relatively thin on the ground. In the <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi> essay 'The Elizabethan Lumber Room,' VW compares Sidney's prose style in the <hi rend="italics">Defence</hi> with that of <rs xml:id="psn-mmon">Michel de Montaigne</rs>' s <hi rend="italics">Essais</hi>, demonstrating '[h]ow little Elizabethan prose was fit for its office, how exquisitely French prose was already adapted' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 56). Sidney's writing is 'an uninterrupted monologue [which] is never quick, never colloquial, unable to grasp a thought closely and firmly, or to adapt itself flexibly to the chops and changes of the mind,' whereas Montaigne 'is master of an instrument which knows its own powers and limitations, and is capable of insinuating itself into crannies and crevices which poetry can never reach; capable of cadences different but no less beautiful; of subtleties and intensities which Elizabethan prose entirely ignores' (57). She concludes that '[a]n age seems to separate Sidney from Montaigne. The English compared with the French are as boys compared with men' but that nevertheless the 'Elizabethan prose writers, if they have the formlessness of youth, have, too its freshness and audacity' which is most fully expressed in comic prose written for the stage (57).</note>

LLVW contains the first and second volumes of this edition with VW's bookplate. Harrison vividly depicts recent and contemporary Elizabethan England, and Woolf uses his writing as a major source for her descriptions of changes in English society at this period, and as a contemporary source on the theatre and playhouses. She makes three sets of notes on it: the first in preparation for <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi>. In this set of notes she focuses on changing dietary habits as an index for broader social change (<hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 19).

        <note>An anonymous early English morality play, probably based on the Dutch play <hi rend="italics">Elckerlyc</hi> (Everybody). The play is a religious allegory, its characters given demonstrative names such as Death, Good Deeds, Knowledge, and, indeed, Everyman. It is explicitly pedagogical: the incipit of the first print edition calls it a 'treatise how the High Father of heaven sendeth Death to summon every creature to come and give account of their life in this world, and is in the manner of a moral play' (Everyman 181, 0.1). The moral play dramatises the titular Everyman's journey to the grave: in the play's opening lines, God sends Death to Everyman. In the play's first half, Everyman is deserted by Fellowship, Kindred, and Goods; they cannot prevent his end, but they encounter Good Deeds. Good Deeds lies paralysed on the floor but nonetheless sends Knowledge to 'go with thee and be thy guide | In thy most need to go by thy side' (ll. 522-3). Knowledge leads Everyman to Confession, and they revive Good Deeds. His soul saved, Everyman goes to his grave willingly. The play received its first attested performance in 1901 and this performance 'opened the floodgates to its modern popularity' (Bruster and Ramussen in Everyman 67).</note>

        <note>Probably the last play <rs xml:id="psn-cmar">Christopher Marlowe</rs> wrote before his death. Woolf read the play at least twice: she writes in a letter to Thoby Stephen dated 1901 that she has been reading Marlowe and 'was much more impressed by him than I thought I should be.' She had read 'Dr Faustus, and Edward II' and thought Marlowe's characters were drawn 'with more humanity' than those of the 'great man' <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">Shakespeare</rs>, whom Thoby idolised (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>1 45-6, §. 39).

In her diary entry for 25 December 1931 she writes of reading 'Faust' but it is not clear whether she refers to Marlowe's play or Goethe's (1808; 1832), a German-language copy of which is in LLVW with Leonard Woolf's signature.</note>

          A reference to Andrew Marvell's pastoral English poem 'The Garden,' published initially in 1681. The poem celebrates the retreat from society into 'delicious solitude' (Marvell 49, l. 16), and the pleasures both of nature and of the <hi rend="italics">vita contemplativa</hi>. The stanza Woolf cites reads in full:

          Mean while the Mind, from pleasure less,
          Withdraws into its happiness:
          The Mind, that Ocean where each kind
          Does streight its own resemblance find;
          Yet it creates, transcending these,
          Far other Worlds, and other Seas;
          Annihilating all that's made
          To a green Thought in a green Shade. (50, ll. 41-8)

        <note>Ibsen's 1881 drama <hi rend="italics">Gegangere</hi>, (lit. 'those who return' but most commonly translated into English as <hi rend="italics">Ghosts</hi>) is a controversial play whose subject matter was, at the time, shocking: it deals with incest, syphilis, and euthanasia. Woolf uses it as a point of comparison between early modern English drama and contemporary drama: she posits that the audience in the Jacobean playhouse must have felt emotions akin to those provoked by Ibsen's play. These feelings were strong: Ibsen's translator William Archer compiled press notices of the first English performance in 1891 into an article called 'Ghosts and Gibberings.' The first, a leader from the <hi rend="italics">Telegraph</hi> calls it an ' "open drain; a loathsome sore unbandaged [...] Literary carrion... Crapulous stuff",' and the others that Archer cites are similar (Archer 3). Its initial reception has not stopped the play from being produced many times since then. <hi rend="italics">LLVW</hi> contains a twelve-volume edition of Ibsen's works which includes <hi rend="italics">Ghosts</hi>: Woolf could have read of the play's early reception in Scandinavian theatres in Archer's introduction to the play (Archer in Ibsen xx-xxiii).</note>

Henry James print too, wh. I am to boil into 7 or 800 words' (234-5). Evidently, she did not boil enough as on 15 February she reports receiving a letter from her editor 'enclosing that wretched review, &amp; asking me to cut it down, &amp; send it back as soon as possible. So I set to work with scissors &amp; somehow patched it together' (237). Her notes for this review are extant (cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 35). In her review, she damns with faint praise, likening James to 'an artist who, with a sure sense of anatomy, paints every bone and muscle in the human frame; the portrait would be greater as a work of art if he were content to say less and suggest more' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>1 23). She mentions the novel infrequently after 1905: in 'Is Fiction an Art?' (1927), VW's review of <hi rend="italics">Aspects of the Novel</hi> by E.M. Forster, Woolf critiques Forster's 'notably harsh judgment' of James, asking 'Why, if we get a keen and genuine pleasure from the pattern of <hi rend="italics">The Golden Bowl</hi>, is it less valuable than the emotion which Trollope gives us when he describes a lady drinking tea in a parsonage?' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 461), while in 'On Being Ill' (1930), she says that this is not a 'book for influenza' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 201) LLVW contains a 1905 first British edition of James's novel, presumably the copy which VW received to review.</note>

        <note>A tragedy by <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> which dramatises titular prince of Denmark's halting quest for revenge against Claudius for the murder of his father. Woolf reads and returns to <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi> throughout her life. VW begins reading this play as early as 1909 alongside other four other tragedies: <rs xml:id="lit-rome">Romeo and Juliet</rs>, <rs xml:id="lit-lear">King Lear</rs>, <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi> and <rs xml:id="lit-macb">Macbeth</rs>, supplemented with <rs xml:id="psn-acbr">A.C. Bradley</rs>'s <hi rend="italics">Shakespearean Tragedy</hi> (cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 29), although this was not her first encounter with the text: in 'Sketch' she recalls reading the play aloud to Julia Stephen at some point before her death in 1895 (<hi rend="italics">MoB</hi> 96) and her diary entry for 12 November 1897 is simply 'Hamlet' (<hi rend="italics">PA</hi> 133). In her 1916 essay 'Charlotte Brontë' she writes that '[t]o write down one's impressions of <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi> as one reads it year after year, would be virtually to record one's own autobiography, for as we know more of life, so Shakespeare comments upon what we know' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>2 27). The play spurs VW's mature insight that 'we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself': in 'Sketch' she cites <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi> as part of the 'truth about this vast mass that we call the world' (<hi rend="italics">MoB</hi> 81). VW's deep and lifelong engagement with <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi> is too complex to fully describe here: Fox's 1990 account remains authoritative (94-158 cf. especially 103-108). In addition to editions of the play in four sets of collected works, LLVW contains a standalone edition of the play and an 1860 dual facing-page facsimile that displays both 1603 (Q1, sometimes referred to as the 'Bad Quarto'), and the 1604 (Q2) variants.</note>

Woolf reviewed the first tranche of this edition in 1923 for <hi rend="italics">Nation &amp; Athenaeum</hi>: her essay, 'Mr Conrad: A Conversation' does not discuss 'Heart of Darkness' specifically, but the conversationalists do discuss Marlow, the narrator of many of Conrad's stories including 'Heart of Darkness' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>3 377-8). Similarly, VW's 1924 obituary of Conrad for <hi rend="italics">TLS</hi> (collected in <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi>, 1925) does not cite 'Heart of Darkness' but does discuss Marlow (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 231).</note>

        <title level="a">History of England</title>
        <author>Trevelyan, G.M. [George Macaulay]</author>
        <note>A 1926 work by historian <rs xml:id="psn-gtre">George Macaulay Trevelyan</rs>. VW took notes on this in 1940 in preparation for the 'Anon' drafts: the edition in LLVW also contains LW's annotations. Trevelyan's narrative stretches from prehistoric Britain to the death of Queen Victoria, though Woolf's notes peter out after the Stuarts. The ecological fantasia that opens many of the 'Anon' fragments, where early human music is prefigured by birdsong, draws inspiration from and cites the opening of Trevelyan's history (cf. Trevelyan 3). She also makes notes on the lack of literacy among the ruling classes of early England, and the subsequent development of bardic culture and the impact that this had upon the medieval sensorium: 'The form and colour of things seen and the sound of fine words were a greater part of the pleasures of that simple age than in our own more intellectual world' (86); on the impact that the Norman conquest had on the formation of the English language (131-2); and the 'growth of a leisured class' (146). Her notes then skip ahead by several hundred pages and several hundred years to Trevelyan's discussion of the influence of the Bible and of music on English art (367).</note>

        <note>Tragedy by <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> that sees the aging Lear divide up his kingdom among his three daughters, Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia: they must each swear that they love him in order to inherit. Regan and Goneril extravagantly pledge their love; Cordelia can say nothing and 'nothing will come of nothing' (1.1.90). VW begins reading this play as early as 1909 alongside other four other tragedies: <rs xml:id="lit-rome">Romeo and Juliet</rs>, <rs xml:id="lit-haml">Hamlet</rs>, <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi> and <rs xml:id="lit-macb">Macbeth</rs>, supplemented with <rs xml:id="psn-acbr">A.C. Bradley</rs>'s <hi rend="italics">Shakespearean Tragedy</hi>. Fox argues that at this point Woolf identified Lear with her father Leslie Stephen (108-9). Certainly, her early reading of the play is autobiographical: her notes begin with the observation that 'One feels Lear has always been stormy. His daughters have suffered from it,' but it is also somewhat broader: her notes end with the observation that 'all human kind [is] exposed on the heath' (<hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 29, at back 8-9). In the <hi rend="italics">TLS</hi> review 'Men and Women' (1920), VW writes that it is 'becoming daily more evident that <rs xml:id="lit-haml">Lady Macbeth</rs>, Cordelia, <rs xml:id="lit-haml">Ophelia</rs> [...] and the rest are by no means what they pretend to be' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>3 193). The <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi> essay 'On Not Knowing Greek' (1925) the narrator writes of reading <hi rend="italics">Lear</hi> as a process of 'stripping the branch of its flowers instantly' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 48). In <hi rend="italics">On Being Ill</hi> (1930), illness causes the brain's 'barriers [to] go down' and 'the brain rings and resounds with <hi rend="italics">Lear</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 202). In the <hi rend="italics">CR</hi>2 essay 'How Should One Read a Book' (1932), the question 'is <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi> a better play than <hi rend="italics">Lear</hi> is left up to the reader, not 'authorities [...] heavily furred and gowned' to answer (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 573). Fox writes of Bernard's continual citation of the play in <hi rend="italics">W</hi> (Fox 135-6), and of references to the play in <hi rend="italics">BA</hi> (Fox 155-6).</note>

        <note><hi rend="italics">Le Morte Dartur</hi> is a middle English prose narrative retelling of earlier Arthurian legend: its (putative) author, <rs xml:id="psn-tmal">Thomas Malory</rs> translated and reworked French stories of <rs xml:id="psn-kart">Arthur</rs> and his retinue, the knights of the <rs xml:id="obj">Round Table</rs>, moulding them into what he called a 'hoole booke.'

Though Arthurian mythology is vast and diffuse, VW consistently uses this work as her source. LLVW contains two editions of Malory's work, including an 1899 edition by Edward Strachey, from which Woolf quotes herein. Strachey modernises and regularises Caxton's text, presenting an edition 'for ordinary readers, and especially for boys, from whom the chief demand for this book will always come' (Strachey in Malory xvii). Evidently LW was one of the boys Strachey's introduction gestures towards: the copy of the book in LLVW bears his inscription.</note>

        <note><rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs>'s tragedy of witchcraft, regicide, and revenge, colloquially referred to as the Scottish Play. VW begins reading this play as early as 1909 alongside other four other tragedies: <rs xml:id="lit-rome">Romeo and Juliet</rs>, <rs xml:id="lit-haml">Hamlet</rs>, <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi> and <rs xml:id="lit-lear">King Lear</rs>, supplemented with <rs xml:id="psn-acbr">A.C.

Written in the wake of a disastrous trip to Europe with Vanessa and Clive Bell, VW's 1909 notes pay close attention to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's relationship (cf. Fox 101). In the <hi rend="italics">TLS</hi> review 'Men and Women' (1920), VW writes that it is 'becoming daily more evident that Lady Macbeth, <rs xml:id="lit-lear">Cordelia</rs>, <rs xml:id="lit-haml">Ophelia</rs> [...] and the rest are by no means what they pretend to be' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>3 193), while in <hi rend="italics">Room</hi>, Lady Macbeth is listed among the 'women who have burnt like beacons in all the works of all the poets from the beginning of time' (39). In <hi rend="italics">On Being Ill</hi> (1930), illness causes the brain's 'barriers [to] go down' and 'the brain rings and resounds with <hi rend="italics">Lear</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Macbeth</hi>' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 202). In 'Ellen Terry' (1941), VW writes of John Singer Sargent's painting of Terry 'robed and crowned as Lady Macbeth' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 288).

        <note>A fantastical and explicitly metatheatrical comedy by <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs>, probably composed 1595-6. VW read this play once: in a letter to Julian Bell dated 2 May 1936 she tells her nephew that she read it the previous night, commenting 'Well there you have it — all England, all May in a song or two' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>6 33, §. 3126). If she made notes while reading, none survive, and she only mentions it once by name in her fiction and essays, and very rarely uses its characters' names: in <hi rend="italics">O</hi>, the young Orlando writes a piece called 'The Birth of Pyramus' (71). In a letter sent to Quentin Bell on June 8 1930, she tells her nephew that '[t]omorrow there is a village festival [in Rodmell] — our cook dances on the lawn — they act Midsummer Nights Dream and I am to guess the weight of a cake' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>4 176, §. 2189). This, perhaps, finds its way in the 1911 chapter of <hi rend="italics">Y</hi>, in which Celia tells Eleanor Pargiter that she has seen a ' "scene from Shakespeare"' but cannot remember which play: ' "<hi rend="italics">Midsummer-Night?

        <date>1919-1920</date>
        <note>A work of universal history written by H.G. Wells, read in <hi rend="italics">BA</hi> by <rs xml:id="psn-lucy">Lucy Swithin</rs>. Wells' narrative stretched from the earth's beginnings and the 'very oldest rocks' (Wells 5), through the fossil record to prehistoric humans and the emergence of agriculture, Bronze and Iron age civilisations (with a focus on the ancient Near East) through to what he calls 'the world tragedy of 1914' (565) and the 'failure to produce a more satisfactory world settlement' in the wake of the First World War (594). It concludes by looking to a quasi-messianic future 'Federal World State': Wells writes that this is 'our true State, this state that is already beginning, must be now this nascent Federal World State to which human necessities point' (601). He looks to a 'moral and intellectual revival, a religious revival [...] stripped of corruptions and freed from its last priestly entanglements' (602) and argues that his 'new telling and [...] common interpretation of history' (603) is a necessary part of the revival that will lead to his global utopian world state. The Woolfs owned a 1920 edition of Wells' <hi rend="italics">Outline</hi>, presented to Leonard Woolf by Wells. This volume is among the 130 books belonging to the Woolfs collected in HRC rather than LLVW.</note>

        <note>An extravagantly gory satire that recapitulates a great many tropes and figurations common to the revenge tragedy genre. Written for the King's Men in 1606 (Jackson in Middleton i.544), published anonymously in 1607-8 and mistakenly ascribed to <rs xml:id="psn-ctou">Cyril Tourneur</rs> but now credited to  <rs xml:id="psn-tmid">Thomas Middleton</rs> (i.546). The play opens with Vindice holding the skull of Gloriana, his 'poisoned love' (I.i, l. 14) and swearing to 'give Revenge her due' (I.i l. 43) by exacting vengeance on her murderer, the Duke. Also plotting revenge and jostling for position at court are Duke's sons, Lussurio and the illegitimate Spurio; his wife the Duchess and his stepsons Ambitioso, Supervacuo and Junior join the fun. Vindice has his revenge when he disguises himself as Piato, a 'pander' or pimp, and is hired by the Duke to 'greet him with a lady | In some fit place veiled from the eyes o'th' court' (3.4.11-12). The lady in question is the skull of Gloriana, dressed in a wig and dress, its mouth smeared with poison. The Duke kisses Gloriana's skull and dies a painful death as the poison eats at his teeth and tongue. Some time later Vindice attempts to frame the Duke's sons and stepsons at a masque held at the new Duke Lussurio's court, which sees Lussurio murdered: in a frenzy the other sons kill one another. In the play's very final moments, Vindice is found to have engineered everything, but he accepts his death, asking 'are we not revenged? Is there one enemy left alive among those' (5.3.107-8). In M1-8, 5 of 10. The Reader, Woolf highlights an 'extraordinary intensification' that 'comes fitfully' to the Jacobean stage: <hi rend="italics">The Revenger's Tragedy</hi> is nothing if not intense in the single-mindedness of its satire and, of course, its sheer and unstinting violence. VW's 1916 essay 'Hours in a Library' lists <hi rend="italics">The Revenger's Tragedy</hi> among the 'list of books that someone read in a past January at the age of twenty' (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>2 56).</note>

        <note>Cf. <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs>'s tragic tale of two star-crossed lovers. VW begins reading this play as early as 1909 alongside other four other tragedies: <rs xml:id="lit-lear">King Lear</rs>, <rs xml:id="lit-haml">Hamlet</rs>, <hi rend="italics">Othello</hi> and <rs xml:id="lit-macb">Macbeth</rs>, supplemented with <rs xml:id="psn-acbr">A.C. Bradley</rs>'s <hi rend="italics">Shakespearean Tragedy</hi>. She was not impressed, writing 'Who shall say anything of Romeo &amp; Juliet? Do I dare? — in private: it seems to me immature work' and that the titular lovers 'have very little that is individual' in their relationship with one another. However, she expresses a preference for the Nurse and Old Capulet (<hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 29 3). VW's assessment of the play remains, as Fox describes it, relatively stable (101). She begins to take notes on the play again in preparation for <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi> but only writes 'There is of course perfect character drawing in Capulet &amp; the old nurse,' and copies out a quotation from Old Capulet (<hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 47). In the <hi rend="italics">CR1</hi> essay 'The Pastons and Chaucer' (1925), Woolf writes of a 'certain kind of humour [which] depends upon being able to speak without self-consciousness of the parts and functions of the body' and which is expressed through characters such as the Wife of Bath, or Juliet's nurse (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>4 29).  In <hi rend="italics">ND</hi>, Mrs Hilbery suggests that her daughter Katharine has a 'dash of the old nurse in [her]' (323).</note>

        <note>Jacobean drama written in the late 16th century by <rs xml:id="psn-kyd">Thomas Kyd</rs>, though only attributed to him after his death and considered anonymous until 1773. The play was most likely composed after the Battle of Terceira on the 26th July 1582 (Calvo and Tronch in Kyd 13) and certainly before the 23rd February 1592 performance by the Lord Strangers' Men that <rs xml:id="psn-phen">Philip Henslowe</rs> records in his diary, though he calls it 'spanes comodye donne oracoe' [Spanish Comedy of Don Horatio] (Henslowe i.13). Though no record of its first performance survives, it was nonetheless 'one of the first and longest-lasting Renaissance box-office hits' (Calvo and Tronch in Kyd 1), and Kyd's play revitalises Senecan tragedy for the English stage and originates the revenge tragedy genre. The play narrates Hieronimo's elaborate quest for revenge over the murder of his son. Hieronimo's desire for revenge drives him mad, leading him to stage a play within a play that sees him kill his son's two murderers before biting out his own tongue and killing both the Duke of Castille and himself. The play was enormously influential on the Jacobean and Elizabethan stage, providing a theatrical lexis that would be deployed by playwrights includng, <hi rend="italics">inter alia</hi>, <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">Shakespeare</rs> (cf. <hi rend="italics">Titus Andronicus</hi>, <rs xml:id="psn-haml">Hamlet</rs>) and <rs xml:id="psn-tmid">Thomas Middleton</rs> (cf. <rs xml:id="lit-reve">The Revenger's Tragedy</rs>). Cf. White (307-10) for a reconstruction of the play's first performances at the <rs xml:id="pla-rose">Rose</rs> playhouse. The Woolfs had a standalone 1898 edition of this play in library, published as part of the Temple Dramatists series (cf. <hi rend="italics">LLVW</hi>).

        <note><rs xml:id="psn-cmar">Christopher Marlowe</rs>'s two-part historical epic play vividly and viscerally depicts the Scythian shepherd Tamburlaine's rise to become ruler of a vast empire and his subsequent demise after burning the Qu'ran and rhetorically challenging the prophet Mohammed. It was evidently a crowd-pleaser, being frequently performed at <rs xml:id="psn-phen">Philip Henslowe</rs>'s <rs xml:id="pla-rose">Rose</rs> playhouse. VW took notes on both parts of the play, although non-consecutively. Her notes are collected in a composite notebook kept from 1922 to 1928, made up of loose leaf paper. In August 1923: she read the second part alongside <rs xml:id="lit-faus">Doctor Faustus</rs> and The Jew of Malta, writing that 'T. can embody his greater extreme of thought in words w. topple over, not ridiculous, so much as unwieldy' (<hi rend="italics">RN</hi>25 28-30), while at some other point she read the first part of the play. Though this set of notes are sequenced after those taken in the summer of 1923, it is plausible that she read it beforehand, based on her observation that she expected Tamburlaine to face a 'downfall after his behaviour, to the virgins especially' (<hi rend="italics">RN</hi>25 39-41). Tamburlaine does not face his expected downfall until the end of part two. Though she discusses Marlowe in essays and novels, she does not mention either play by name elsewhere in her corpus.</note>

        <note>One of the four tragicomedies or romances <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> wrote towards the end of his career (the others are <hi rend="italics">Pericles, Prince of Tyre</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Cymbeline</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">The Winter's Tale</hi>). VW read this at least once: in a letter dated 7 January 1926 to VSW she says she is reading 'some of the Tempest, to compare with Defore' in preparation for her essay on Defoe's novel published in <hi rend="italics">The Nation and Athenaeum"</hi> and collected in <hi rend="italics">CR2</hi> (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>3 226-7 §. 1608, cf. <hi rend="italics">E</hi>5 376-82, <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 4). However, it is probable that she had encountered the work prior to 1926. As Clarissa Dalloway and Mr Grice discuss Shakespeare in <hi rend="italics">VO</hi>, Grice quotes from the start of Ariel's song, 'Full fathom five...' though both express a preference for <rs xml:id="lit-hen5">Henry V</rs> (<hi rend="italics">VO</hi> 55, cf. <hi rend="italics">Temp.</hi> 1.2.396-412). Terence Hewet's apostrophising of Rachel Vinrace as a 'creature who'd lived all its life among pearls and old bones' also echoes language from this song (<hi rend="italics">VO</hi> 341). In a letter to Molly MacCarthy dated 19 January 1923, VW cites Ariel's song, writing that she has been 'struck down by the usual old temperature, which sinks my head fathoms deep in mud. Ought one not to find one's father's eyes when one sinks fathoms deep?' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>3 5-6, §. 1348). On 9 May 1934 VW visits Shakespeare's house in Stratford-upon-Avon and, on looking at 'Shre's garden' is told by the caretaker that ' "That was where [Shakespeare's] study windows looked out when he wrote the Tempest."' (<hi rend="italics">D</hi>4 219). Fox references Shakespearean allusions, including to <hi rend="italics">The Tempest</hi> in the drafts of <hi rend="italics">Y</hi> (Fox 148-9).</note>

        <note>A compendium of quotations, maxims, and sententiae collected by <rs xml:id="psn-bjon">Ben Jonson</rs> akin to a commonplace book, though Pebworth points out that it differs formally and stylistically from other contemporary examples of the genre, and is most likely a synthetic compilation of loose reading notes (164-5). It was published in 1640-1, shortly after Jonson's death in 1937. VW gestures to this work in her 1934-5 reading notes to the <rs xml:id="lit-faer">Faerie Queene</rs> (cf. <hi rend="italics">RN</hi> 45). <hi rend="italics">Timbers</hi> discusses Spenser twice: once in section 63, 'Censura de Poetis' [Judgement of the Poets], in which Jonson laments that public opinion ranks John Taylor, the self-proclaimed Water Poet, above Spenser (Jonson 34), and again in section 106, 'Praecipiendi Modi' [Modes of Teaching], Jonson writes of the order in which a pupil have writers introduced to them: he counsels teachers to introduce '<rs xml:id="psn-psid">Sidney</rs> before Donne' and to 'beware of letting them taste <rs xml:id="psn-gcha">Chaucer</rs> and <rs xml:id="psn-jgow">Gower</rs> at first, lest, falling too much in love with antiquity, and, not apprehending the weight, they grow rough and barren in language only.'

        <note><hi rend="italics">A Woman Killed with Kindness</hi>, by <rs xml:id="psn-they">Thomas Heywood</rs>, was first performed in 1603 though the earliest surviving text of the play dates from 1607. The play arguably originates the genre of the domestic tragedy, and its two intertwining plots deal with lust and chastity, friendship and duty, retribution and pity: for more detailed summaries of the play's two plots, cf. <rs xml:id="psn-acto">Acton, Sir Francis</rs>, <rs xml:id="psn-frana">Frankfort (Frankland), John</rs>, <rs xml:id="psn-franb">Frankford (Frankland), Anne</rs>, and <rs xml:id="psn-wend">Wendoll</rs>. The cry of 'Oh God' that Woolf cites in M.1-8-5. The Reader, fol. 2 punctuate the play: Charles Mountford cries 'My God – what have I done? What have I done?' (3.41) when he realises he has killed two of Acton's retainers, and Mountford's sister Susan, similarly, cries 'O God! O God!' (3.103) when her brother is imprisoned for the crime. Wendoll cries 'O God! O God! With what a violence | I am hurried to my own destruction. | There goest thou, the most perfectest man | That ever England bred [...] And shall I wrong his bed?' (6.16-20) when he is torn between his friendship with John Frankford and his infatuation with Anne Frankford. Having been told of his wife's infidelity by his servant, John Frankford says to himself in soliloquy 'O God, O God. | Shall I put up these wrongs? No. Shall I trust | The bare report of this suspicious groom | Before the double gilt, the well-hatched ore | Of their two hearts?' (8.102-5), and again cries 'O God, O God' when his servant presents him with irrefutable evidence of Anne and Wendoll's affair (13.47). He again exclaims 'O God' when discovering his wife's lute after having banished her (15.13), before directing his servant to bring the lute to Anne, while Wendoll provides the final O God, lamenting that he has 'divorced the truest turtles | That ever lived together' (16.49-50) on hearing Anne play this lute one final time.</note>

        <note>A comma is a butterfly of the species Polygonia c-album. In <hi rend="italics">A History of British Butterflies</hi> (1853 but reprinted well into the twentieth century), naturalist F.O.

With its wings closed, the butterfly looks like a fallen autumn leaf; its wings open to reveal a 'beautiful rich fulvous orange colour.' Cf. Morris (70-72).

        <note>A district in the City of London between <rs xml:id="pla-stpa">St Paul's Cathedral</rs> and the Thames, centred around Blackfriars Bridge, which gave its name to two indoor, private playhouses, the latter associated with <rs xml:id="psn-wsha">William Shakespeare</rs> and his theatre company, The King's Men. The area is named for a priory of Dominican friars (known as 'black' friars owing to the colour of their garb), who acquired land here in 1275 (Chambers ii.473). Over the next three centuries the priory waned in influence, and its estates were dissolved in 1538 by <rs xml:id="hen8">Henry VIII</rs> (ii.476). A theatre was established in the former priory in 1576 (ii.496-7). This first theatre hosted companies of boy actors and shuttered in 1587. In 1596, the building's refectory was sold to James Burbage, father of the Shakespearean actor Richard Burbage (ii.503). On James Burbage's death, his son inherited the theatre but he and the King's Men were prohibited from using it due to a combination of legal and business strictures until 1609 (Edmond n.p.), after which time its decades-long association with Shakespeare began: Shakespeare's company used it as an indoor playhouse during London's cold winters. Though it was smaller than outdoor public theatres such as the King's Men's other theatre, the <rs xml:id="pla-glob">Globe</rs>, it attracted an aristocratic and royal audience, though as Gurr notes, it was this royal association that proved 'one of the kisses of death that destroyed the King's Men and all the other players' in the wake of the English civil war, 'when Parliament signaled its opposition to their royal attachment by closing the playhouses in September 1642' (Gurr in Menzer 29). In Woolf, upon her return to England, Orlando's property is siezed pending a court case to decide her legal status and, consequently, whether she has the right to own property. She is permitted to live in Blackfriars for the duration of the case – CHECK note.</note>

        <note>The Chopping Knife was likely a tavern or hostelry in central London, but concrete evidence attesting its purpose or location is scanty. Newdigate-Newdegate collects an account of seventeenth-century gossip whose locus is the Chopping Knife, and whose key actors are <rs xml:id="psn-mfyt">Mary Fytton</rs> and <rs xml:id="psn-wpem">William, Lord Pembroke - CHECK</rs>. The quotation which VW excerpts here reads:

          One Mrs Martin who dwelt at the Chopinge Knife near Ludgate tould me [that] she hath seene preists mary gentlewomen at the Courte, in that tyme when that Mrs Fytton was in great fauour, and one of her Majestie's maids of honour , and duringe the time yt the Earle of Pembrooke fauord her she would put off her head tire and tucke upp her clothes and take a large white cloake and marche as though she had bene a man to meete the said Earle out of the Courte. (36)
          
        Beyond this, little evidence attests to the existence of a place named the Chopping Knife or its function. The City of London Corporation Library contains a collection of seventeenth century tradesman's tokens, effectively an illegal form of coinage issued not by the state but by individual traders, collected by Henry Beaufoy. The 1855 edition of this collection's catalogue references a coin with a 'chopping knife.' On its obverse is written 'IN THE STRAND' and on its reverse 'IN WESTMINSTER' and the initials 'S. S. M.' (Burns 232, §. 1122). The Strand is a historic street in the City of London that runs from Trafalgar Square to Temple Bar and then (as Fleet Street) up to Ludgate Hill and <rs xml:id="pla-stpa">St Paul's Cathedral</rs>. What kind of establishment the Chopping Knife was is not recorded.VW read Newdigate-Newdegate in preparation for the 'Anon' drafts, and specifically notes down this part of the narrative (<hi rend="italics">RN</hi>37). </note>

Built in 1599 from the dismantled timbers of the Theatre playhouse, Gurr describes its construction as an 'attempt to retrieve something from the disaster of the Theatre's closure and the ban on the use of the <rs xml:id="pla-blac">Blackfriars</rs> hall playhouse' (369). Its lease was initially held in common by members of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, including Shakespeare, actor <rs xml:id="psn-wkem">William Kempe</rs> and financier Richard Burbage: this is notable because 'for the first time, actors became joint owners of the playhouse in which they worked, and the Globe became the first playhouse designed for a specific company' (White 317). The 'wooden O' that the prologue of <rs xml:id="lit-hen5">Henry V</rs> (prologue, 13) most likely references was burnt down in a 1613 performance of Henry VIII ' "by negligent discharge of a peal of ordinance"' which landed in the building's thatched roof, setting light to it (Chambers ii.419). The playhouse was almost immediately rebuilt, and only met its end when the building was ' "pulled downe to the ground [...] on Munday the 15 of April 1644, to make tenements in the room of it"' (ii.427).</note>

        <note>A seventeenth century tavern on <rs xml:id="pla-lond">London</rs>'s <rs xml:id="pla-chea">Cheapside</rs>. The tavern continues to have literary-historical resonances: playwright and poet <rs xml:id="psn-bjon">Ben Jonson</rs> was among its frequenters, as was <rs xml:id="psn-fbeau">Francis Beaumont</rs> and his collaborator John Fletcher. A drinking society named the 'Fraternitie of Sireniacal gentlemen' are also associated with the tavern: O'Callaghan suggests that John Donne was part of this group.

        <note>A county in the east of England with many Woolfian resonances. VW most of August 1906 in Norfolk when the Stephens rented the Elizabethan manor house Blo' Norton Hall, in a remote part of the county: it was '7 miles from a railway; &amp; every mile seems to draw a thicker curtain than the last between you &amp; the world' (<hi rend="italics">PA</hi> 310). While at Blo' Norton, she wrote the short story 'The Journal of Mistress Joan Martyn,' set in the locale. Some decades later, in a letter to Vanessa Bell dated 25 May 1928 VW writes that she and LW are considering selling Monks House after 'some hanky panky with the agent behind [their] backs' leads to the sale of their terrace and the threat of building work thereon: VW 'see[s] from advertisements one can get the most ravishing old houses with gardens and orchards in Dorset, Suffolk or Norfolk for a mere song' (<hi rend="italics">L</hi>3 500, §. 1895). They drive along the north Norfolk coast in March 1932: VW's joy in the 'lovely lonely coast' between King's Lynn and Cromer is tempered by her grief at the recent death by suicide of Dora Carrington (<hi rend="italics">D</hi>4 84).
          
        In <hi rend="italics">VO</hi>, St John Hirst comes from Norfolk 'the son of the Reverend Sidney Hirst, vicar of Great Wappyng in Norfolk' and later refutes the rumour that he has 'Jewish blood in [him]' as his family has 'been in Norfolk, Hirst of Hirstborne Hall, for three centuries at least' (160, 232), while in Woolf's next novel, Ralph Denham takes a cottage in Norfolk (310) but does not leave London before the novel's end. The county is part of the mental landscape of several characters in <hi rend="italics">MD</hi>. Richard Dalloway is not a fan of his wife's parties: in an aside we learn that 'to do Richard justice he would have been happier farming in Norfolk' (69), and his thoughts turn to Norfolk and its 'soft warm wind' as he shops for jewelery with Hugh Whitbread (101). Among the credits to Whitbread's name is 'the protection of owls in Norfolk' (92), while Mrs Hilbery questions whether 'some Mongol had been wrecked on the coast of Norfolk [and] had mixed with the Dalloway ladies' (110). Captain Frederick Marryat, whose writings and <hi rend="italics">Life and Letters</hi> Woolf reviews in the 1935 essay 'The Captain's Death Bed' died in Langham, ' "two miles from the sea, on the coast of Norfolk'" (<hi rend="italics">E</hi>6 65). <rs xml:id="psn-tbro">Sir Thomas Browne</rs> lived in the county town, <rs xml:id="pla-norw">Norwich</rs> (cf. entry on Browne for more details), and the <rs xml:id="lit-past">Paston</rs> family took their name from the town of Paston, on the north Norfolk coast (cf.

        <note>The Rose playhouse in London's <rs xml:id="pla-bank">Bankside</rs> was named after its location, in a former rose garden and a ' tennement then called the little rose wirth twoe gardens"' (cf.

Its foundations were excavated in 1989 and archaeological work at the site has evidenced the construction both of this specific theatre and others like it (Orrell and Gurr).</note>

        <note>Prehistoric standing stone circle on Salisbury Plain, two miles from <rs xml:id="pla-ames">Amesbury</rs>. While staying in Salisbury, August 1903, VW visited Stonehenge twice with Vanessa Bell. She wrote a sketch in her diary on each occasion. In the first sketch, she writes that 'The singular, &amp; intoxicating charm of Stonehenge to me, &amp; to most I think, is that no one in the world can tell you anything about it. There are these great blocks of stone; [...] &amp; what more? Who piled them there &amp; when, &amp; for what purpose, no one in the world [...] can tell,' and calls the circle 'a piece of wreckage washed up from Oblivion.' Given that the culture that built Stonehenge left no written records, many of VW's questions remained unanswered or unanswerable. Later on she writes that the most 'attractive, &amp; I suppose most likely' theory about the megalith's purpose is that 'some forgotten people [...] built here a Temple where they worshipped the sun,' and conjectures that a fallen stone in the middle 'may have been an altar' on which 'the Priest of that savage people slaughtered his victim [...] in honour of the Sun God' (PA 199-200). In her second, briefer, sketch describing their second visit, she calls the megalith 'a kind of altar made of earth, on which the whole world might do sacrifice' (205). These early descriptions and suppositions are of a piece with her invocation of Stonehenge as a site of ancient ritual in M.54-8.</note>

She contrasts it to <rs xml:id="pla-stpa">St Paul's Cathedral</rs>: whereas St Paul's Cathedral is 'spacious and serene,' Westminster Abbey is 'narrow and pointed, worn, restless and animated' (301) and far from being silent, the dead interred there, the 'Kings and Queens, poets and statesman still act their parts and are not suffered to turn quietly to dust' (302).

VW returned at a later date, when the house was open to the public and 'the public [could] enter the great gates of Wilton as freely as any Herbert in the land.' She was not altogether pleased with the excursion: 'Honestly, I was disappointed in my first view of a great house. I had imagined something more spacious &amp; more harmonious.'
